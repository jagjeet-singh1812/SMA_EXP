MqzIngyeWYU,Black womens hair products are in the safety spotlight Heres what to know,2025-03-29T13:00:33Z,UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA,women safety,US,35,123,0,,it's been a part of our culture for years I don't think braids is going anywhere we've been getting them since we were young like we getting braids at 2 three now many people do use braids you can see them when you go on vacation but the fact of the matter is that the most common um consumer would be black women so what we're saying that in this small study we found 90% of the products for instance having lead one of the products had no heavy metals for instance so that one tells us well you can make this stuff safer and we suspect that if we had tested wider we would have found more samples my first was it's about time that people were thinking about exposures that are really isolated to certain racial and ethnic groups for a consumer report this digestible and a start this is great but moving forward we're going to have to have rigorous methods I should probably start bringing awareness to clients cuz that's serious you know the more that we can raise awareness that some of these cultural routines could potentially provide harm is us having the potential to stop that harm

_kiV9SA75Fw,Woman Says quotPatriarchy Threatens Women39s Safety and Woman Says quotThere Should Be No Societal Pressure,2025-03-28T23:28:33Z,UCWC9y-2d3TA7lDY8fXZTLkQ,women safety,IN,1,6,2,All that complaining just to say I dont want to lead,"[Music] a wife's primary duty is to serve her husband i believe that as just a person as a woman in general my first priority is to God and being obedient to him but being a wife I believe being a submissive wife and loving your husband as we have been asked to by God um I believe that that's the foundational purpose of being a wife and then in turn leading your children when I first got married I got married at 18 feel like in my role as a wife I have learned that in order for me to be a good mother in order for me to be good in our marriage i am putting him first and I am serving him and that's my priority it's crazy how this type of woman is not the norm anymore uh back in time not so not so far long ago too this was the normal type of woman but now we have the modern woman yeah I mean I definitely agree um I got married at 21 years old um I was never really like the you know independent woman i grew up with a single mother and when I first met my husband we were 14 years old and it instantly I was like this is the man that I want to marry and it really made me dive into being a godly wife so you kind of you touched on that a little bit and I 100% agree that when you're serving your husband um you have to also serve God and if you do not have that kind of relationship with your husband that you do with God then it's going to kind of lead down the path of like I'm me and I care about myself and he's going to care about himself instead of making those he's actually right you know a relationship that's uh intertwined with uh religion and God it's uh there's a better stronger foundation there you know there's a level of accountability that you have because you're accountable to God the higher purpose a higher power so it would definitely be harder for you guys to break up it'd be like breaking up with God itself right sacrifices for each other so I definitely you know for myself I try to put him above all obviously I do take care of myself it's not like I'm just like oh yeah like she can just go down the drain it's a give and take so I fully am there for my husband and whatever he needs me to do is something that I look forward to doing for him because whatever you give you will receive so I try to be the best wife that I can be to him so that he can be the best husband that he can be to me y have the disagree step forward do you see the difference between the agree and disagree you could It's It's the look it's a certain feel that they give off so does it go both ways is it is it just I should serve my husband not my husband should serve me as well you see she's automatically looking to get something it's that's what happens when you don't believe in God it's just automatically me me um so in our view and as I believe Christians should have that view is your husband is supposed to love you as Christ loved the church and that actually is a bigger task than wives submit to your husband so in turn I'm submitting to him but he is actually supposed to be obedient to God which means he's supposed to love me as much and if he loves me as much as Christ loves the church then it's going to be a mutual relationship exactly you know so since the husband loves God and he worships God and he uh is going to listen to his teachings he wouldn't mistreat his wife because one of God's orders is treat your wife good you know so that's another reason why women should look for men that have faith because they will not dishonor God so they won't dishonor you essentially if we're going to have mutual conversations mutual decisions be made it's not that he's ruling over me he's telling me what to do and taking charge of everything it's that he loves me enough to care for me as he should i think as any husband should for his wife yeah 100% i think that um a big misconception with submitting to your husband is that it's I submit to him and he has the final say and he does whatever he wants and I don't have a say it's more of like okay I I'm going to come to you with my opinions and these are the ideas that I have and at the end of the day he will decide on the ideas you know but I do have that say i can go to him and I say ""Okay well I think that we should move to Thailand."" And he's going to decide if that's a good idea for us or not it's not like he comes in the house and he's like ""Yeah we're moving let's go."" Yeah a good man will listen a good man will you know counsel with his wife and take her suggestions you know but ultimately it should come down to the man's say right that's all it is but we do take your suggestions go back why does he get to decide that's what I was wondering because leadership is a service because he's a better leader and he's more logical so the service he provides is his leadership and if you've ever been in a leadership position then you'll know that it's actually an immense weight to carry to lead people and and just carry that final responsibility and as a servant leader you know you have their best in mind when you when you are leading people so that's that's the service that he provides and it's actually Yeah well it I guess that's a great question it depends on how you would define submission being a triedwife so as a Christian I would say there's definitely a line my first priority is to God and u my husband can't cause me to do anything that would jeopardize that and he can't treat me in a way that's dishonorable or not generous so I think I in my partnership with my husband it really does feel like a partnership and so I disagree in the sense that for us major life decisions even dayto-day decisions there is negotiation between the two of us often times I will win most negotiations why would you be happy that you're bullying your husband it's kind of you're just pretty much showing that he's a weak man sometimes as well but there is a foundation of trust communication leadership but I think for us our marriage functions more like a partnership where um yeah I guess mutual uh I'm pretty sure he's in this relationship where he's walking on eggshells he's essentially just telling her ""Yeah yeah sure."" But in his heart he wants to put his foot down but he can't because she might use um sex for compliance or you know he might have to sleep on the couch or the silent treatment so he just doesn't want to go through something like that so he'll just agree you know uh trust and negotiation comes into a play a lot more than uh you know we're doing this and that's how we're doing it so and do you guys believe that the man or the husband should be a leader just because he is the male or is it because he displays certain leadership qualities could it be the other way around if the woman well some certain men are not smart or leaders you know but it's up to the woman to identify if this man is worthy enough for her to be led by him you know you just got to choose a good leader you got to scan him from head to toe and just analyze is could this guy lead me to the promised land was somebody who would fit better into the role of a leader um no it's it's built in it's like baked in in biology so hormonally you know men's No I don't agree with that how so um I mean sure you can say that there are bi See she said that she didn't agree but now she's pretty much saying she agrees with the biology part you see that's why men have to be leaders because her first response was emotion you can't lead by emotion like that logical difference between a man and a woman but that doesn't make why I get so upset because why are men inherent triggeredly born deserving respect but we have to earn all of our respect we're not born with respect we have to earn it you know everybody has to earn their respect she thinks that it should just be given but no you have to earn all respect in this life right there was there's no biology that says because of feminism we have to earn it because of feminism where we made ourselves compete with men rather than relaxing into our feminine maturity exactly you wanted to be equal this is it we don't have to earn yeah what do you think feminism is i'm just curious of course it is it's the leveling of the playing ground for the two genders yes well um I would go by the definitions of the firstwave feminist who sought to overthrow the family and that's what they sought to do i don't think that's true so who who would you say were like the first wave well feminism the the typical definition is social political and economic equality between the sexes i don't think anything in that definition is saying we should overthrow the family or that we don't believe in loving uh marriages or partnerships but when you say these biological differences between men and women make men better suited to be a leader which ones and where is where's like your basis for that what what skills men are larger they're stronger hormonally men produce more vasopressin which is the hormone that makes them better um protectors and providers they're able to just respond better to threats whereas women produce more oxytocin we're smaller we're more vulnerable we're the fairer sex the oxytocin is a trust and you know bonding hormone that we're supposed to use to take care of those weaker than us like children like the sick the poor the elderly when we channel that you know that the way that God made us then those people are actually under our authority as women we have the responsibility to care for them just like men have the responsibility to use their strength to care for us i just I think what's standing out to me is that these biological differences that you're noting is actually something that feminism is seeking to actually support because true feminism at its core is about the safety and equity for women in society so that women cannot just it's not about dismantling the family what's what does she mean by the safety like this is 2025 women are the safest ever in history especially uh in uh North America i don't know about you know other other third world settings but North America set up maximum safety for women we got police we got the fire departments we got the air conditioning we have everything to keep them comfortable and safe what is she talking about it's about creating agency for women to choose their lives not at their not not based on you know whatever your personal beliefs are or the beliefs that are outlined by society but whatever path that they have chosen for themselves that's at the true core of feminism it's not about women being better or stronger or the same as men it's about women being safe in this world no it's about being equal to men in a world where the patriarchy threatens women's safety and agency sorry sorry whoa how does the patriarchy threaten your safety we keep you safe without men without good men bad men would take you guys over you know they would have have their way with you we are the safety can I ask how how are how are you threatened how am I threatened so I'll I'll tie it back to the biological differences that you noted there i got to hear this there there's a reality that women face both biologically which we all can you know we all all of us here can understand and empathize with but also just like within society there is a there's a pretty unequal steep right and so for the role that men occupy just in general in society and the freedom that men are able to maneuver through society with that to me is why feminism is so necessary to open paths for women who might otherwise not be able to she didn't explain how we're how the men are a threat she just gave a word salad and said nothing at all about anything recently in Iran recently in Iran I'll give you an example recently in Iran there was a woman who was protesting because there was a strict dress code policy she had to go all the way to Iran to make a point booked the ticket and everything you like we're talking about women in North America first world how are you unsafe and on top of that how does the patriarchy meaning men make you guys more unsafe please explain i would like to know and she walked through the streets in her protest within her underwear it was a very brave courageous act that is of true feminism and what happened she was disappeared so if you look at the way that society treats women's bodies versus men's bodies that inherent difference it creates violence that threatens us at our core and so by feeling as though we need to submit ourselves to men to me that that sounds like a like a defense mechanism and imagine tying your safety to that one story so she's basically saying she's afraid of her safety in North America because of a story of something in that happened in Iran in their culture like isn't that mental illness that's got to be mental illness what stands out when I'm listening to you all speak and I and and if you find empowerment through submitting to your husband that's fine but for me personally my brand of feminism is that I think that if a woman finds empowerment through that more power to her but I think that the women who don't find that empowering should also have the ability or the agency to do as they please that's just how I view it yeah can I circle back something you said earlier so a lot of this oh they're bigger than us and is true men on average are far bigger than women but I don't see how that goes into like how emotional someone is or how these leadership skills that they have no but it's if that was the case then why This girl knows the the science and biology but she's playing dumb like you know like she knows that women get periods and they're more emotional this that and that she knows the whole but she's acting like it doesn't exist i don't get it why did God create so many women that are excellent attorneys excellent doctors it's almost 50% of the field now that these women are killing business owners why did they give Why did God give so many women because there's so much overlap when it doesn't come to physical strength between men and women on things like how agreeable they are if they're able to have those leadership qualities so many women were blessed with those absolutely women are are brilliant yeah so women are excellent adviserss and mothers and teachers and influencers right we know about that women are great influencers they're the most powerful influencers so I'm not in any way saying that women aren't capable i'm just saying should we go out and compete with men or should we actually take our power and harness it and use it in other ways and in fact some of the anti-suffragettes held this belief they were concerned that if women achieved suffrage that their influence would be diluted because they would be forced to go out and compete like headtohead and they would kind of just lose that status as being admired as wise counsel in society so so like these females that are like pediatric surgeons like some of the top in the field you don't think they're doing as much of a service as if they were just to stay home and nurture well I think they're putting themselves at a disadvantage too because look at the wage gap there does exist a wage gap even if you have a really skilled like female surgeon and a male surgeon and it's because biologically like they can't push and push and push themselves at the same in the same way that a man can so like no this is true i I disagree completely i've seen women not only not only do women usually um meet expectations they exceed them in in a lot of situations and I don't think that you can say like there are so many women who have just could you please give an example and stop being so vague like I they don't ever give examples of anything they just say the women are so great at this and but but what exactly is the this and that could you explain further please been so much far greater than their male counterparts in and almost like what like what exactly what profession what industry because from what I know men dominate all fields that they're in so I I I don't know exactly what she's talking about in what in a lot of situations in in like in school in science in in in all of these places where women are coming to the forefront and say and like doing their jobs and doing them well they've not only exceeded but they've had to work twice as And why do they have to work twice as hard because of the patriarchy huh what a cop out everything because of the patriarchy what what do you mean by patriarchy are you talking about a certain group of men or you talking about all men twice as hard for them because we are we are bodies like we are built that we are constantly working i'm working right now cuz my body's getting ready to ovulate right whereas men don't work in that same way like my body is always working harder than a man's body i will say that we are working harder because our bodies are built to do something that a man could never do do you believe that then the wife should lead the family no I think that I agree you see all this complaining but you don't even want to lead you see what I'm saying they want to be known for being good leaders but they don't want to lead so do you not understand why men are suited to be leaders because we naturally want to be leaders the math is not mathing with these people agree with her that it's a partnership like that a man should never be thought of as the final decision as that how he is suddenly able to to lead and know know but they can't even see how they're illogical you know even just that one statement they don't want the man to be just the automatic leader but they don't want to lead so it's like what are you complaining about it's very childish at this It's very childish everything and know all and then she is just here to I don't know serve and sit by it's like they don't want to help they don't want to serve you they want they don't they don't like that word that word serve it's like they think it's slavery automatic slavery but if you're mature and you understand what that word means it's not a bad thing they need to just be reprogrammed from that different lens is needed people should be looked at as individuals and not based on their gender so there could be areas of expertise that my partner is is better equipped for and there are areas of expertise I am better equipped for and to your earlier point like it it's like women didn't have advantages for so long and now we're seeing this shift where like boys need our help because as soon as you let women into education we started surpassing them and our wages have gone up okay so women do uh enroll into college and university more but they tend to go with the teaching nursing psychology majors compared to men that follow the whole science technology and math path right so her point about going to college more doesn't make you guys better leaders sorry up and up and up let women into education could you clarify that no no saying as soon as we started pushing for like women to get into STEM and we started doing this push to get women educated we not only met the the same standard that men were operating at we exceeded it and now women are outperforming men in almost all like exams I don't think women I don't think people that's cap man people should do anything I think people can do anything I don't think there should be any societal expectation on any person man or you see that's the problem I have with their form of leadership there's no structure She just said nobody should have any roles or any expectations in society you can just do what you want but that's not how the world works there's expectations and there's roles for everybody you know everybody's got to play a part without any structure without leadership without defined roles I just think there's total chaos and total mayhem and that's why men should lead because women don't want to on to the next manifest my own destiny sex drugs and rock and roll the perfect recipe may they remember me my words are live on i'm guided by an energy of flame hold it close to you check out my melody this is the media that's been leading you i'll show you a thing misdirection what's the message they don't want you to win"

safety has come in as the number one issue for the voters of Tamil Nad in this poll that Cota has done Um Rahul I think that's a very real concern I think we've had several high-profile incidents where uh you know there have been assaults and rapes and uh it has really struck a chord I do think that uh in terms of local governance I don't know whether it's the state government should set that tone and tenor but a lot of this boils down to very local issues uh as we know from global statistics you know rape and assault and threats to women's safety usually come from a known person in a majority of cases obviously here there have been many cases where it's been a stranger and to that extent it reflects law and governance sorry law and order issues at a very local level or you know it's not like a statewide alarm has been raised So I think what you're seeing is the accumulation of many such small incidents and certainly I think the DMK wants to do better on one parameter It needs to pull up its uh soft you know the fact that women security comes up so high up in this poll It's not you know price rise unemployment are cookie clutter generic issues they'll feature in any poll but women safety is like a really strong message to Stalin and to your government Yes Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Rahul I think it is it's a good thing that people put in women safety as the top priority Uh because the DMK government gives so much of importance especially to the women No that's not why they put it there They put it there because you're not doing a good enough job They put it there because you're not doing a good job on human safety which is why it's the number one issue That's the way to interpret the data No no no no Let me let me come come allow me to speak See if you look at the data of the last 10 years crimes that have taken place during the ADMK regime and compare that with what is happening in the last 3 years there is no increase In fact there is a decrease and in the recent times of India survey where almost six cities from the uh state of Tamil Nadu feature in the safest cities in India for women That is how we maintain the women's issue Okay We know Svin wants to come in and respond to the issues that matter to the voters of Tamilad and women security Svenan interpreting the data to show that they're doing an amazing job which is why it's coming up on top not because they're doing a bad job Let Vinod Selv respond Rahul I Rahul I I I remember Saran asking you who's your English teacher I would ask I would like to ask him the same question who is this English teacher because you know it is very basic and it's very understandable that the people are very you know when you come to a show about data and polling you should ask where did you study statistics and economics and polling that's far more relevant than where did you study English but please go on who is your max you know it is very concerning what is happening to the women of the state you know the number of uh cases of molestation harassment have been going up by the day and somewhere if you see all these people are related to anyone who is a part of the DMK So you know being in the DMK or using the DMK flag in the car gives them the signal gives them the license to do whatever atrocities against women and go scot-free Also the issue of alcohol and drug abuse has been going up extremely high and also with regard to the survey I was little concerned when you were talking about Vijay getting 18% But after you said that the DMK satisfaction is at 15% I'm very much convinced that the survey has not been done the right manner because 15% can be convinced about the DMK's good governance It's a big joke in the state because everywhere you go you find disgruntled people completely unhappy with the way this govern there is no governance literally It is just about how they project one family and the next uh prince in in line you know to be uh made this chief minister very soon Uh in his talent I remember s also asking about has any sports minister ever performed like this before Has any sports minister ever been given so much importance before Have any has have all the ministers rallied behind any one minister before like this You see all the seniors stand up in line most of them coming falling on his feet taking blessings That's the kind of importance that is being given this one family It's like a monarchy what is happening in Tamil Nadu So I don't think uh any of these surveys really matter 2026 is going to be the year of the NDA and the NDA is for sure to form the government in Tamil Nadu notwithstanding what DMK or any LKG party like the TVK is going to come to the frame Well you're being dismissive of the TVK If their leader comes in at 18% double that of your state president you shouldn't be dismissive That that is absolutely correct

empowerment it's about reclaiming your sense of security and confidence in a world that can often feel unpredictable and unsafe it's about equipping yourself with the knowledge and skills to protect yourself in any situation whether you're walking home late at night or navigating a crowded space knowing how to defend yourself can make all the difference for women especially self-defense training can be transformative instilling confidence and a sense of control over their safety it's not just about physical strength it's about mental resilience and preparedness by learning simple and effective techniques women can deter potential attackers and escape dangerous situations these techniques are designed to be easy to remember and execute even under stress self-defense empowers women to trust their instincts and take charge of their well-being it teaches them to be aware of their surroundings and to recognize potential threats before they escalate it's about breaking free from the fear and vulnerability that can hold them back when women learn to defend themselves they also learn to break free from the societal expectations that often limit their sense of autonomy every woman deserves to feel safe and secure and self-defense training is a powerful step towards achieving that it fosters a community of support and solidarity among women creating a network of empowered individuals who can rely on each other sharing experiences and learning together can be incredibly empowering women who train together often form strong bonds encouraging and uplifting each other through the process the journey of learning self-defense is also a journey of self-discovery it's about finding inner strength and realizing that you have the power to protect yourself and others practicing self-defense in various scenarios helps women to be prepared for different situations it builds confidence in their abilities and reassures them that they can handle whatever comes their way reflecting on the journey many women feel a profound sense of pride and accomplishment they realize that they are not just learning to fight they are learning to live without fear as women become more skilled many choose to pass on their knowledge teaching self-defense to others and inspiring the next generation this creates a ripple effect spreading empowerment and safety throughout the community self-defense training brings together women of all ages and backgrounds fostering a sense of unity and shared purpose it's a reminder that together women can create a safer and more empowered world ultimately self-defense is about more than just physical techniques it's about empowering women to live their lives with confidence and assurance knowing that they have the skills to protect themselves and those they care about every woman deserves to feel this sense of empowerment through self-defense training women can reclaim their power build their confidence and create a safer world for themselves and others the journey of self-defense is ongoing but with each step women move closer to a future where they feel secure and empowered together they can make a difference one self-defense class at a time the most effective self-defense techniques begin with awareness pay attention to your surroundings trust your gut feelings and avoid potentially dangerous situations if something feels off it probably is walk with purpose maintain a confident posture and make eye contact awareness extends to your online presence as well be mindful of the information you share and avoid posting your location in real time remember self-defense starts with being proactive and minimizing risks you don't need to be a martial arts expert to defend yourself simple techniques focusing on vulnerable areas can be highly effective strikes to the eyes nose groin and knees can disable an attacker and give you a chance to escape another essential technique is learning how to break free from grabs and holes by targeting pressure points and using leverage you can create space and escape an attacker's grasp the human body has natural weak points that you can exploit to your advantage in a self-defense situation the eyes nose and throat are particularly vulnerable targets a sharp strike to these areas can cause significant pain and disorientation giving you time to escape the groin is another highly sensitive area and a well-placed knee strike can instantly incapacitate an attacker remember the goal is not to engage in a prolonged fight but to disable your attacker and get to safety section five step-by-step guide mastering the basic techniques let's break down some simple yet effective self-defense techniques first the palm strike open your hand fingers together and strike upwards towards the attacker's nose or chin next the elbow strike bring your arm up bending at the elbow and strike the attacker's jaw temple or nose then the knee strike lift your knee upwards aiming for the groin with force lastly escaping from a front choke grab the attacker's thumbs push down and step back to create space section six real life scenarios putting your skills to the test imagine walking alone at night and someone approaches you aggressively use your voice shout back off to draw attention and deter the attacker if they grab you remember your techniques target their weak points break free and run to safety another scenario you're being followed in a parking garage trust your instincts walk with purpose and head towards well-lit areas if the person persists have your keys ready to use as a weapon or to quickly unlock your [Music] car section seven beyond the physical the power of confidence and voice confidence is not just a state of mind it's a powerful tool that can influence how others perceive and interact with you when you carry yourself with confidence you project an aura of strength and self assuredness that can deter potential threats self-defense is not solely about physical techniques it's also about projecting confidence and using your voice the way you present yourself can be just as important as knowing how to physically defend yourself confidence can be a shield that protects you from harm attackers often target individuals who appear vulnerable or timid they look for easy targets people who seem unsure of themselves or who might not put up much of a fight this is why it's crucial to work on your confidence and body language by walking with your head held high making direct eye contact and speaking assertively you send a clear message that you are not an easy target these small changes in your demeanor can make a significant difference in how you are perceived by others your voice is a powerful weapon it's not just about the words you say but how you say them a strong assertive voice can convey confidence and authority making it clear that you are not someone to be messed with don't be afraid to shout yell or draw attention to yourself if you feel threatened your voice can be your first line of defense alerting others to your situation and potentially scaring off an attacker a loud assertive voice can startle an attacker and alert others to the situation it's a way to take control of the moment and shift the power dynamic in your favor remember confidence and voice are not just about self-defense they are about empowering yourself in all aspects of life section 8 practice makes perfect maintaining your self-defense skills learning is not a one-time event it's a continuous journey that requires dedication and regular practice it requires ongoing practice to develop muscle memory and ensure you can react instinctively in a dangerous situation is crucial because in high stress scenarios your body needs to react without hesitation find a reputable self-defense class or instructor in your area and commit to regular training consistency is classes not only help you learn new techniques but also provide a safe environment to practice and refine your skills even practicing basic techniques at home with a partner or using a punching bag can reaction time and confidence home practice allows you to reinforce what you've learned in class and adapt it to your personal environment remember the more you train the more prepared you'll be to defend prizes regular practice builds not only physical skills but also mental resilience it helps you stay calm and focused under pressure discussing strategies with your instructor and peers can also provide understanding different scenarios and how to handle them can make a significant difference in real life situations try to practice in different settings to simulate real life scenarios this low light conditions in confined spaces or with distractions the more varied your practice the better prepared you'll be for any situation additionally consider learning how to use self-defense tools alarms these tools can provide an added layer of security and can be effective when used correctly reflect on your progress regularly celebrate your improvements and identify areas self-defense is not just about physical strength it's about empowerment and confidence support from your peers and instructors can be incredibly motivating encourage each other and share your experiences together strong supportive community that values safety and empowerment in conclusion maintaining your self-defense skills is a lifelong commitment stay dedicated keep practicing and remember that stronger and more prepared your safety and confidence are worth the effort section nine conclusion embrace empowerment live fearlessly self-defense is not about living in fear it's about living with confidence and empowerment by equipping yourself with the knowledge and skills to protect yourself you can navigate the world with greater peace of mind trust your instincts be aware of your surroundings and never hesitate to use your voice and your skills to defend yourself remember your safety is your priority and you have the power to protect yourself
ZZ46Stah3m4,The TRUTH About GenderBased Violence,2025-03-29T13:18:36Z,UCSwnP4fZZz4lmUhF2Zam2WQ,gender violence,KE,0,4,0,,every single day millions of women and girls across the world face the harsh reality of gender based violence whether at home in their communities or during times of conflict gender based violence is all forms of violence that happens to women girls men and boy because of the unequal power relations between them so gender based violence is not just a physical act it can also be emotional it can be uh physical obviously it can be sexual it can be economical and it's important that one understands that and it also happens in the private and in public so it's not just confined to public or to a private it can be either from the alarming rise of intimate partner violence to the use of rape as a weapon of War gbv remains one of the most pressing human rights crisis of our time amid is this pain however there is resilience Brave survivors activists and organizations are fighting back breaking cycles of abuse and demanding change question is are we listening and more importantly what are you doing to stop it I didn't even finish my animon the next day in the morning I left why reason being when we got married uh the place we were in sorry the place we were in there was lighning in the in the bedroom so everything was okay until it got into three so personally I'm sleeping I'm the type of a person when you move I feel yeah you are a light sleeper exactly when you move I just feel so yeah I'm just sleeping I hear from a distance it a phone is ringing so for me I'm like okay but I don't bother so the moment he moved so I'm like I'm up then I heard him talking I saw him tiptoeing to go to receive the call yeah yes so he received the call oh so the word that woke me up is hi babe so I I sat down hi babe your desire so the love of your life the love of his life still more red flag yeah so how hey babe how have you been so you know myself I sat down because I'm like Am I Dreaming or is it the real thing and then he tells the lady I'm sorry we haven't been talking M and yet he was busy marrying marrying me yeah so I woke up after I woke up I switched on the lights then so I'm like who are you talking to he's like oh I'm talking to Pastor John God oh he calls Pastor John babe yes exactly and he's on a mission exactly to break your heart I tell you that the question I asked and he was was like oh babe my question is who is that Pastor you're calling babe who is that Pastor Mission and you have been busy marrying me like oh babe you know you're misunderstanding you just guess things you don't know me I went I took the phone I checked it was a lady by the name Babe by the name babe over 370 million girls and women worldwide are raped or sexually assaulted before they turn 18 that is one in every eight girls sexually assaulted as a minor in Africa alone over 79 million girls and women are victims of gender based violence that translates to one in every five girls having faced or undergone gender based violence take amina's story for instance Amina was a bright girl with dreams of becoming a doctor she enjoyed mathematics and Sciences and loved to run in the fields near her Village she loved the sound of her mother's laughter then one evening while she was walking home from school everything changed a man she knew a man she trusted a man she will call Dad pulled her into the Shadows she screamed she tried to fight but no one could hear her he was stronger than she was when it was over she was left broken bleeding and alone she told her mother but instead of Justice she got silence no one must know she said it will bring shame to the family she said that they were encouraged by the adults in that school they were told this is nothing go have a bath and change and put on your uniform and go to class where I was shame when her body was taken away from her where was shame when the man she knew and trusted ripped her apart where I was shame when our silence yes your silence and my silence allow such incidences and crimes to continue happening AA story is painful but is it new today 17-year-old girl Adan Abdi has been murdered for refusing to be married to a 55 year-old man in Kenya tonight we bring you what is probably the most disturbing news story of the day a 17-year-old girl has been killed and has set her body set on fire for listen to this refusing to marry a 55y old man in the county of a the odds were already tipped against Gala Aiden Abdi since she was from a refugee family in DB refugee camp beforeand timely death girl Adan Abdi had left several voicemails to her mother emotionally recounting the physical abuse she was receiving daily from both her husband and his relatives revealing that she did did not want to be in the marriage in the first place and would rather go to a refugee camp and find a living this stories echo through history they echo through the pages of even our most sacred text take the story of t for instance today however tama's name is spoken again AA story is told and girls like girl Adan Abdi have a chance to be rescued because silence is no longer an option it is our mandate to find survivors of gender based violence to stand with them and to tell their story with strength because by doing so we give strength to more girls and women who are trapped in the same Vice of gender based violence it was never bad at first he was Flawless the man could sing your desires in Perfect Harmony he knew what I wanted and showered it on me I was so happy I showed him off to anyone I thought would be jealous of our love the first time I heard ringing my heart stopped like my brain had forgotten how to make it beat it took about a minute for my entire nervous system to reset the presets yet he couldn't pick an expression between shock and upset till I finally said did you just hit me this crisis isn't far from us it is in our homes in our communities in our schools it is in the songs that we sing in the movies that we enjoy in the jokes that we love to and in the cases that we dismiss this crisis is in the victims that we blame that means that we have the power to change the narrative power to demand Justice power to believe survivors and power to create a world where girls like T Amina and girl Adan Abdi never have to suffer in silence again so the real question is what will you do because gender-based violence is not just their fight it is ours it is now and it must end

oanda means honey for those who don't know and yeah I am honored to share my insights on how youth lead initiatives are shaping the gbv advocacy and this is not just through activism but through Innovation resilience and community-driven solutions and um whoever bonke I will be prompting to share the next slide so kindly share the next slide yeah so objectives the objectives for today will be three to continue to create awareness because like Bon mentioned before the people who still do not know about gbv you tell someone there's such thing as gbv and they think those are stranger things another objective that we will have for today is showcase strategies that help the youths or will help the youths in the grassroot levels to continue to fight for gbv and the other objective will be to inspire action this is basically or will be basically about um a call to action next slide [Music] bonke thank you the contents in this um slides I only have a few slides and I'll try to be as engaging as humanly possible so that you do not get bored as you can see on the screen we will be talking about the reality of gbv at the local level we will talk about why the youth should be involved in advocating for gbv and why right now we will talk about youth Le strategies during this change or to just drive for this change we will also explore the impact of Youth Le initiatives what has worked for me even in my experience and lastly we will talk about the challenges and the way forward next slide thank you uh the reality of gbv at the local level I want this to be a very engaging session so I would like you to drop a text in the chat box talking about your key awareness uh gbv awareness campaign if you could design a gbv awareness campaign what would be your key message I'll give us 30 seconds to to contribute to this discussion in the chat box by saying what our key message would be if you are tused with coming up with a gbv awareness campaign okay as we continue to do that I will share what my key message would be and uh that would be silence protects the abusers your voice protects survivors that would be my key message that would be my tagline any day all day every day I don't know what your tagline would be but feel free to give us your input in the chat box about what your kidne should be next slide Bon uh I can see N M's um input she's saying every voice matters gender equality for life thank you so much NE for your input I agree and I appreciate your comment thank you so so much uh we will continue with the presentation in the interest of time but feel free to continue giving your input in the chat box so gender based violence is a persistent crisis that is affecting millions and especially women and girls and I'm not saying that boy the Boy Child Community is not affected by gbv The Boy Child Community is also affected by GB gbv and sadly some of these cases are under reported and even when you go to a police station for example or if you talk to your friend and say that you were beaten by your wife or your girlfriend they think it's a joke or they make it look like or seem like it's a joke and they think you're a Simpson or a kukus or something but the reality of the matter is that even the boy child is suffering and these statistics I was I was at an event last week on Friday and someone said give a a tally of the number of women who had died from femicide last year and he said that the number is standing at 179 last year alone and you see this 179 is not just statistics these are people it's it's an alarming number nobody should die not even one person that's one many and these statistics when you say 170 it's 170 this is Somebody's Daughter this is somebody's mother this is somebody's sister this is somebody's friend this could be you this could be me you know that is why we need to continue to fight against homicide in gbv and at the local level gbv is often under reported it is normalized it is dismissed and in fact to some extent it's even a laughable thing when you say when you tell someone that you were slapped when you tell somebody that you are you were you you were denied food for example if you tell somebody that your husband decided you will not be going to work that he wants to provide for you they tell you that is love you know like you have gone to school as a woman you have graduated you had a whole career ahead of you and then now you get married and somebody tells you no you stay at home a woman is supposed to stay at home you sit back fold your hands and I will provide for you and then you think that is love and this makes everything just difficult for survivors to seek Justice and support when you continue to normalize these things when you Contin continue to normalize their um their their complaints or when they speak up we just laugh about it we make it difficult for them to come forward and talk about the issues that are distressing them next slide bonke know the next one that's the previous next slide um the next after this thank you so uh one would ask why then do we need to involve the youths in the fight against gbv and also why now and the answer is pretty simple the youth population is not just the future we are also the present and that said we are uniquely positioned to challenge these harmful norms and to also leverage in the digital spaces to create awareness and to also build grassroot movements that hold institutions accountable uh last year when we were doing the end reject the finance bill when we were planning for that protest I remember the youths went on to Tik Tok and different social media platforms to create awareness about what the finance bill was about uh a few even influencers read the finance bill to identify the issues that would directly affect the youths they translated these aspects of the finance bill in their mother tongue and went to Tik Tok and went to the grassroot levels and went to their rural homes to sensitize the people about what the finance bill is about that is the kind of power that the youths have even when we started the protest the numbers were you could we were numberless if you tear gas us today and you expect that we will not come on Tuesday or on Thursday then instead of the numbers shrinking we continued coming out in large numbers to protest against the finance bill and also that is one example even during the end femicide match you would expect that if the Budi is atas today will will not turn up tomorrow but no people continue to show up because they believe in the course because they believe that um gbv is not just a women's issue it's not just a man's issue it's a human rights issue people came out in large numbers we had 16 days of activism the youth across the country had different programs or different projects to create awareness about gbv and they did not end there and what exactly made these youth leads initiatives powerful number one there's creativity and Innovation the youth are now using art they're using social media and Technology to break the silence um around gbv I know Javan the poet is in this call and he will have an opportunity to speak people like him write poems poems that is Art the people like me who are journalists we write op heads there are people um like for for example who is also a human rights activist who does so much in is invited to panels she goes out to protest we are creative and we are Innovative that way another initiative that we that comes to play is peer-to-peer influence young people have the ability to just listen to one another and this this happen more often more often than not it happens with their peers more than it does with their politicians for example or people with authority and this therefore makes the youth uh youth advocates It's very effective in driving conversations around consent around healthy relationship and around Survivor support and even in my class I have noticed even in my class we have a tendency of listening to one another we have a tendency of not necessarily buying but we usually have very constructive conversations in my class I am currently taking a unit on communication and gender and in and in this class it's usually an open dialogue Forum our lecturer has allowed us to talk about um gender and issues like gbv and feminicide have always taken the center stage and you will realize that even when when one of my classmates is speaking about gpv or femicide or lgbtq or any other gender related issue we listen we keep quiet and we listen more than we even do with our lecturers even sometimes when somebody is sleeping and the lecturer is teaching or somebody is chatting we don't do that when a fellow classmate is speaking about gbv and femicide issues so we have a very high tendency of listening to our peers because you can you best believe that the youths of this generation are very walk the Youth of this generation are well read and they're very informed so even when somebody speaks it's not coming from a point of ignorance and the the fact that we listen to each other it means we are also learning from each other and they able to replicate what we have learned in our daily lives another initiative that the youths have used is community-led action so many of us are from communities where gbv is prevalent and I understand that there's cultural and structural barriers that H the progress I will use myself as an example I have been born and raised in kber and in that place BV is like breathing oxygen that's an everyday thing if your man is heat today and you want to report them and say you you want to tell your neighbor there's nothing your neighbor can do because even her's nursing injuries from last night when the husband hit her this is very normal you go to the chief's office I also had the opportunity to practice um journalism at a station called P FM every day I would go to that station you will find more than five women going to report their husbands they're saying oh my husband does not want me to go to work my husband hit me my husband this my husband that this has been normalized even in my own home my parents believe that if you don't listen to your man that man has a right to hit you and they also believe that no man is mad so that he hits you if you have not made any mistake you have to have made a mistake or you have to have provoked him for him to hit you you know and even these conversations as much as you're talking about them in platforms like this you also need to have them the dinner tables at home when my parents keep telling me you know it is not just a comment and it hurts me and it's very heart heartbreaking because we have normalized it just because your mother used to be hit by the by my grandfather and I am sorry that you used to get hit it does not mean I should suffer the same that's uh that's just about it on the community lead and an example of my experience next slide donke thank you um also if you have a question or um if anything is not clear please put that on Ice you will ask the question once I am done uh with the presentation which is not too long actually so we're moving on swiftly to youth Le strategies that are driving change I have mentioned uh digital activism and awareness campaigns Tik Tok Tik Tok sorry Tik Tok and Instagram and Facebook and T have been used to spread awareness about gpv and this has helped to challenge victim blaming and to also amplify the Survivor stories I have noticed that if you look at the comment section even in any social media platforms there always going to be people who are pro gbv and people who are anti- gbv and as much as there's usually a back and forth it is also for some people a learning opportunity the people like me who sometimes do not need to go through the video but we can go through the comment section somebody's SE somebody's comment could be a learning opportunity for me I could look at somebody's comment and be like makes sense I think I can implement this in my campaign there have also been campaigns like end gbv or end femicide and I have to admit we should not be talking about gbv in this day and age gbv should be a thing of the past I want I want us to okay so I I would really want for gbv to be a thing of the past that if I hear gbv I have to look up in the dictionary to know what that means but sadly that is not the case another youth Le strategy that um has been helpful and will continue to be helpful is community based um safe spaces I noticed one thing even in my experience as I shared before about the chief in my area you go and report that your husband hit you but at the end of the day you still go back to that same house that does not work that does not work I have seen places where young people are creating um safe houses for survivors and in these safe houses Jerry could you please mute your microphone and Austin kindly um moving on swiftly I was talking about Community Based spes so there are youth young people who have been able to create safe spaces for survivors and in this um safe spaces the survivors are able to access counseling and legal aid and peer support I've also nule centers and organizations that offer free services where survivors can speak without fear of judgment but my point exactly is I cannot come to you and report about gbv and then I go back to the same house it does not work like that you're not helping me you're adding you're adding salt into injury another strategy is engaging men and boys as allies gbv is not just a women's issue we need to include men and boys active in this gender norms and in this conversations youth Le groups are engaging men in workshops even in this webinar we have men the men who are in this group I want to believe are he for she they are our allies because you cannot talk about gbv and exclude men because even men are survivors some men are survivors some men are perpetrators they also need to be taught that gbb is wrong okay and I have and the youths even in my experience have been able to use workshops mentorship programs and social media um challenges or campaigns in order to dismantle toxic masculinity I also saw the likes of akina ab mut they had this conversation during the international women's day which is a really really good thing another strategy is policy and advocacy and grassroot organizing so the young people are pushing for better laws and they're pushing for stronger enforcement and surv centered policies at the local and National and the youths are using things like peti peaceful protest and Town Hall discussions and they're demanding accountability from government and institutions like I mentioned before last week we had an event on um that was dabbed what next this is a post a post International women's day event and we're just talking about how when every day we go for protest what next after the protest do we go for protest from Monday to December I mean from January to December from Monday to Friday without any accountability what is happening are people being arrested are people being convicted what exactly is happening and after this event we wrote a memorandum that we will we then sent to the technical working group for the one that was Ted by the president to look into the femicide issue these are one of this is one of the things that have been have proven to be effective even at the grassroot level when you're talking to your MP or your MCA you could use S such strategies another one um would be using art and storytelling for advocacy like I have mentioned before I am a journalist I write stories I write opinion pieces the people like Javan the poet who maybe write poems and the people who use spoken word to express Survivor experiences and to also just educate the community uh next slide next slide we almost done actually so the impact of Youth Le initiatives What In your experience or do you think that these efforts that we are making actually make a difference do you think that these efforts that you're putting in place are actually make a difference that is a question I am posing to us feel free to use uh the chat box to give your input but do you think in your opinion do you think that the work that the people that youth are doing that young women and girls are doing do you think that these efforts are actually making a difference okay next slide let's see whether this are these strategies are actually making a difference yeah the the strategies that we have used the efforts that the youths are putting in place young women and girls are putting in place are actually making um strides we have seen that survivors have been empowered to seek Justice people are now coming forward to say hey this happened to me a while back what do I do and people are only able to do that because they know that they're not alone it's also like uh we use an example of the uh of the protest that we had last year there were youths or influencers or youth influencers that were abducted and you could see even after their abduction they came and gave their their account of the story and they were not afraid because they believed that they were not alone there were millions of youths on X on Tik Tok on Facebook on Instagram everywhere who are behind them we have also seen that the community perceptions is also slowly shifting now more people are recognizing that gbv is a human rights violation and it's not just a private issue nowadays if you see somebody is somebody being abused by their spouse you are very likely to help them to help them to seek Justice you are very likely to escort them to the chief or the police station nowadays people are not hiding behind closed doors we have we have also been able to see young people joining movements like myself I am a member of the Nairobi C of Amnesty International that baa has just spoken about there are different thematic areas maybe within the C today let's say we're talking about um gbv you know I know that individuals if I join the C and you join C and somebody else joins COC we are turning this into ual voices into a collective Force for change there's power in solidarity there's power in numbers it's not just Pascal that is's saying it's the entire CC it's not just for he saying it's not just um what's his name who is your I forgotten the name of your leader okay it's not just m that is speaking it's the entire be your best that he's speaking and there's really powering numbers and you will be surprised what these numbers can do next slide as you finish thank you what are some of the challenges that you have faced feel free to continue to give your input in the chat box myself would be even within my household like I have said before I my parents are those kind of parents who believe that in fact nobody can hit you if you didn't not make a mistake or if you did not trigger them you have to have done something nobody is mad you cannot be hit just because somebody enjoys hitting you and you see it's sad because out here you are busy championing for gbv stop gbv stop gbv but in your own house your parents or your brothers believe that you can be hit and in fact they will not be surprised if you get hit in future you know because they keep com saying comments like where you know it's sad but it is something that is happening anyway next slide okay so uh when you're talking about grassroot movements as well we also we we have Community Based organizations in mind I have been in forums where I've had people complaining about funding and they're saying when you're applying for funding some of these donors will say they want an organization that has operated for five years or 10 years and you're just a startup so obviously you do not have that kind of experience but you are motivated to do the work so there's limited funding and resources available for youth organizations and uh we also recognize that many of these initiatives in fact most of these organizations the startup ones in the communities they heavily rely on volunteer power you rely on supporters you rely on people who speak the same language as you for you to be able to push for these initiatives and sometimes that is not sustainable because at the end of the day this volunteer also has other things to do or after some time when this volunteer I have done volunteer work before and I can tell you for free that sometimes an activity that is pay when this opportunity that pays comes up you opt for that as opportunity and you leave this other one you may have the best interest at heart for this other initiative but you're like at the end of the day I still need to eat I still need to pay bills I still need to to shower I need I still need to look good those those things are usually come up and then there's push back from traditional institutions uh I have used an example of my home or of my parents and I would like to also reiterate that even some leaders or some Elders in the community level they just resistant to change they resist they're like so if you're talking to somebody who believes that way or if you're talking to somebody who has been wired by the society to think that way it makes advocacy really hard because you're trying to go left you're trying to make one step forward and somebody wants to take you step 10 steps backwards you're trying to say gbv is are no and somebody is telling you no gbv is okay and sometimes it's even sad because some of these push backs are coming from women somebody tells you no me if I'm not that person does not love me somebody tells [Music] you is really making our advocacy very difficult another challenge that we are having is safety risks for our activists many young people or many young gbv Advocates are facing threats harassment even violence just for speaking out we have seen this severally on different social media platforms you try to speak up against something and then we will we will greet you and that should not be case the case and lastly on the last slide as I wind up this is the last slide guys guys so the youth these youth initiatives or this youth um organizations are calling for more funding and support for youth Le organizations as we have already um exhausted some of these activities include uh would need funding we cannot go out to the grassroot level if we do not have say transport for example we cannot be talking about safe houses how do we keep the lights on in these safe houses also if you keep the lights on do these people in these safe houses just starve to death they also need to eat and they also need to do other things to be able to just grow this is where more funding comes in we also need stronger collaborations with the we also need collaboration with policy makers and institutions we need intersectional approaches that include lgbtq individuals persons with disability and other vulnerable groups we also need sustained efforts through media art and digital campaigns we need to come up as youths with longterm um strategies so that we don't talk about things that work for us today and they do not work for us tomorrow and I would like at this stage I would like to just say thank you for your time thank you for listening I know I have taken up so much time that I did not intend but I appreciate you making the time to just listen and in case you have any questions please feel free to drop them in the chat box and yeah thank you yes thank you pascala so we'll take we'll hold on the questions for pascala right now we'll have them at the end of the session so I'll invite the next speaker and kindly let's speak to a maximum of 10 minutes kindly uh so the next speaker to present their topic is Javan ofula Javan ofula is the interim coordinator of the of the meeting voices Coalition a human rights Defender and a community organizer dedicated to advocating against police abuse of power extrajudicial ex executions and enforced disappearances in Kenya is the co-founder of the dandora community Justice Center dandora that is mwd NGO and IOP CR record label Javan also sits on Javan also sits on various boards for on justice and human rights in addition to his activism he is a Performing Artist using music and creative expression to amplify voices forer Community resilience and push for systematic reforms uh welcome Javan as you speak for digital activism and storytelling leveraging social media and digital platforms to amplify anti gbv campaigns thank you uh hello thank you very much can you hear me well yes ah thank you um yes as has been shared my name is Javan aula but mostly known as Javan the poet and on this uh uh particular convening first I want to thank you uh for having me on board for also inviting me to share my uh experiences opinions and also just the situ as it is on the ground looking at the areas of digital space as we all know gender based violence is a truly a big issue that we have as a nation but also uh that goes across the region Africa and Beyond and thus t
en it informs why I as a person I do the advocacy work that I do but not only on this particular area but I want to speak to this because as mentioned I'm part of the social justice movement of Kenya which is a community based uh movement uh LED and run by people especially young people from various informal settlements uh I'm also part of various uh consortiums or coalitions that work on issues of Human Rights uh with gbv taking uh the center stage uh I want to first start by what informed advocacy on on social platforms or rather on the digital space that now has given us an alternative we've always spoken about the shrinking Civic space but yes as it shrinks on this other side we create and come up with Alternatives with uh the social platforms or the digital space being one of them uh so the social justice movement for example as a commune that is basically dedicated to fighting and addressing issues of gender based violence and this then informs uh our documentation uh of these particular violation in different communities where one we document the violations do referrals work with various partners and also just do follow-ups uh of various cases but that does not end there as uh alluded to or welcomed to speak for is that even documentation on the various social platform or digital space is key because we know that databased violence does not only happen in physical spaces uh nowadays we have so many uh cases of gender violence that are propagated also within the digital right or other dig digital spaces and documentation then informs not only the masses that use these spaces but also helps hello did I hear someone say something should I continue yes please continue okay yeah thank you so uh the documentation then informs uh the masses of what cases happened where how when and how this can then be stood up against uh also these informs uh of victims related uh action how do we then act by um getting victims to get Justice getting victims to get psychosocial support but also getting victims to get support uh in the various spheres healing uh treatment and Seeking Justice using social platforms then comes in so many so many ways uh one simple way has been interpretation of the law where we help the mates to inter what the law says on matters of gender based violence secondly helping the victims to know their rights because there are so many who've been violated but in one way or the other then they don't understand how to proceed how to uh follow through their cases who to go to uh where to get support but also how to make sure that particular evidences that are self available in within the space of the violation available with people around them but also that is needed to make sure that they seek Justice can then be so using the digital spaces is that for example the social justice movement is we populate the data out there we inform the masses of their rights the victims of their rights of the processes and referrals with various organizations that we work with uh secondly is that uh we have also uh involved ourselves with policies that make sure the digital space is safe safe for users safe for ands and of course also a space that information is available for those that seek it and this is where we have Partners who have okay uh okay I can continue yeah so meaning that then the followups are done properly and then we can also articulate these issues to make sure that not that just cases are reported cases are followed through in Justice is met this we do in so many ways because it's not only a shortcoming of those that are violated or are victims but sometimes it's also a shortcoming of Institutions that are out there to help and when we say institutions we've seen cases where even various police stations are not capacitated enough to have gender desks so then this informs the conversation when we have with various stakeholders on how then to populate on how then to invest and on also how then to uh put more resources into such infrastructure uh another way is that we've involved and this now will also touch on me basically uh as a creative is that we've involved uh as many other creative means to um demystify meths around gender based violence uh we've used a creative means to soften the conversations to soften the laws so that people understand them and maintain a space where then they feel that it's not a burden to learn but rather uh a space that is safe for them to express themselves but also to get help in and so far I would say for example uh the gbv committee of the social justice movement has recruited many self driven young people to do advocacy around these on social platforms uh with various webinars with various doing questionnaires uh doing social post uh doing animations and even also capturing artistic works like spoken word you know graffiti uh and and so on uh that there is more and more conversation that is Artistic uh artistically oriented but also that is hosted on social platforms and lastly is that we use social platforms to call out on various stakeholders to have consortiums to have collective bargaining power Collective campaigns and projects against uh gender based violence and such will be um my identity which is a a Consortium of various organizations that have come forth uh to fight or stand up against gender based violence uh thank you that would be my submission for now unless there are particular questions that uh I'll be needed to address I'll be available to do so thank you thank you very much Javan uh due to time sensitivity we'll take all the questions at the end of the webinar at the end of it all we'll take all the questions for each of the speakers uh so next I'll like to invite Mary OD uh Mary ion is the executive director at neurot trust Network and a member at the UN Regional Civil Society Advisory Group for eastern and southern Africa so Mary will'll be talking about uh from awareness to policy influence strategies for young Advocates to shape and influence gbb related policies welcome Mary Ivon hi good afternoon everyone am I audible yes okay fantastic um thank you for the introduction and thank you for the invitation uh my name is mar Von um as I've been introduced and I lead the team at Nur trust Network which is an NGO uh here in Kenya so just to give you a brief background and how we relate to the topic that we're going to be discussing today and um Nuru was founded with a steadfast commitment to building resilience and creating opportunities for marginalized communities across subsaharan Africa and we strong Believers in the power of community-led interventions to drive sustainable change particularly by empowering Youth and women which are the two critical groups at the heart of transforming societies so today I have been tasked with um uh with the topic on uh basically how how young Advocates can now transform their advocacy um into policy and this is um a space that we work in especially with the with the un women Advisory Group and this is also in relation to um International women's day which is a day to honor the advancement um of women worldwide um and male allies and to recognize their uh the ongoing fight for equality and justice um we firmly believe that this particular day which in my opinion should be celebrated every day uh it's a day of um reflection um action and a renewable um commitment to ending gbv in my session today um I will try and keep it uh to the time frame that has been advised will explore actionable um strategies to make that live um because I believe that change doesn't just happen it's driven by informed and empowered voices who dare to challenge Injustice and for me my firm belief as well is that young Advocates have the power to shape gbv which is not a bzw word but I do believe that the polic IES can be changed by combining grassroot efforts with strategic uh policy engagement uh could we go to the next slide please thank you um we've come a really long way over the years addressing matters to do with gpv and as the previous um speakers have emphasized at this point in time we should actually have reduced the statistics ICS that are there just to give you um a global context um un women is the agency that is tasked um with carrying out such activity pertaining to advocacy and awareness and according to their research one in women globally will face physical or sexual violence in their lifetime and this also reduces the chances of us um achieving gender equality which is the fifth SG gbv is not just a statistic it is a lived reality for millions of people it undermines human rights it dos development as we've seen across um our communities it hinders progress towards um gender equality but um looking at this from a positive perspective there have been movements there have been developments and I know each and every one of us on the SK is an advocate towards this and I'd like to highlight uh the mewo movement which I'm sure a lot of us have um are familiar with this movement was started in 2017 that sparked policy changes in workplaces but there are a myriad of other organizations that are working in this space that unfortunately that unfortunately do not have a similar visibility and just to also put this into context this phrase was actually used back in 2006 on a platform called Myspace I don't know how many of us are familiar with it and it was by a lady called Tana uh B so I would really like for you guys to also just have a look into this have a look at how it has metamorphosized um over the years and then you can also just understand how it has grown to what it is right now and where the gaps are and how we can essentially step in and having Collective voices we get to break the silence and we get to demand change I know a lot of grassroot efforts struggle with funding reach and policy traction but this is where all of us together can step in as we are the generation that refus to accept the status quo hence the reason why we're here today could you please go to the next slide it is important for us to be able to merge our voices together as this campaign started with a public outrage that eventually involved into a movement that resulted in concrete legal reforms our stories our voices how we actually project ourselves and our persistence can shatter barriers and rewrite laws and change is possible when we refuse to be ignored so there are more recent campaigns uh just bringing you back uh to to some um advocacy campaigns that have the tollfree line that was um launched uh late last year by the by the national government affir affirmative action fund and since I don't have a lot of time um I know we are also quite familiar with the number of um athletes that we saw either being burnt or being bitten those who those who have died which is so unfortunate um and now there is a toll-f free line that has been launched providing support for athletes um kopa as well has uh launched um a campaign called commercial Duma which tackles workplace harassment and just looking at all the different stakeholders on this page this illustrates the power of collective action you also has a safer compasses intive I which started and highlights the the need for institutional Frameworks in addressing gbv so this is not a government issue this is not a Grassroots um um problem this is not an NGO or the Ino space this is every single person that needs to join hands in order to reduce the the the lived realities of what people are going through in communities and as uh the first speaker um posed a question to us what sort of action are you going um are you going to take what sort of campaign are you going to participate in to bring your voice out for us to be heard for us to be in safer communities I think it's quite important that we all take heed we all take our time um to understand how we can structure the message that we want to get across and ideally how to communicates with the rest of the world out there I also want to highlight uh the digital space and this um I've I've truly been coached on the tech Side by a colleague of mine called Kevin wer who's a passionate Tech specialist and basically there are so many um case studies that I can share around here but social media and online petitions have been very very effective in terms of communication in terms of getting your messaging across and this helps us to redefine advocacy last year I know we've spoken about the finance bill we we we've spoken about um um femicide but it just goes to show that online platforms mobilized or rather sparked action in the offline space and we are the first generation again I I I reemphasize this we are the first generation with the power to mobilize Millions with a single post but again we also have to be extremely careful because with digital activism also come challenges such as online harassment and misinformation and I implore you guys to follow Kevin wer on LinkedIn he shares tidbits around this he speaks about this in terms of um digital safety and at Nuru he leads a program called Viana digital where he also coaches and trains on this so it's important for us to um use these tools to raise our voices to demand a ability and action um when it comes to building capacity for policy and advocacy I know with the youth space there are a number of challenges out there we can go on and on and on but I am a firm believer of joining hands I'm a firun believer of sharing resources and coming together as one to be able to lift each other up and it's important that advocacy is backed by knowledge and strategy young Advocates need to access need access to policy literacy um programs uh to mentorship to networks and organizations that we that we have here today uh like be your best and amnesty ker as well they provide essential training and access to resources to such spaces neurot trust Network um also does and by doing this we actually help young people like ourselves to get around the policy processes um and engage um decision makers out here from the grassroot uh stage all the way to the government and when young people are equipped with um information there's a lot that can change so I want us to invest in whatever resources we have in our different capacities to be able to influence the future and because we are are in the Grassroots I I I definitely had to add this in to also show how collaboration can work um from a grassroot perspective sustainable change begins in our communities it be um it begins in our homes um as Javan um has spoken about the kind of work that he does you can see how his community LED initiatives and the kind of work that he does spark such changes um in the spaces that he's in it's important to also work with different people in terms of um capacity um uh trainers who are in this space it's also important to work with uh traditional leaders it's important to work with faith-based organizations um and I also want to highlight not just in Kenya but there but there's an organization in Uganda called raising voices if you have a moment also please have a look at them they have they are basically a grassroot organization that have been able to lead campaigns to influence policy changes in Uganda also another one is called Empower youth Africa Foundation we have groups in Kenya there's contast there's crew there's the Kenya Community media Network there are very many ways to collaborate and a lot of ways to be able to enhance the voices that we have um and the spaces that we're in and my call to action I'm trying to keep to time my call to action out here I I want to highlight I know there's a lot that uh we speak about in terms of accessing certain spaces but systemic changes requires Collective action we need to work or move around Global initiatives like generation equality by un women and these are resources if you go online you will see how to register your organization or ideally how to engage with them forging Partnerships with um entities like plan International it's easy to push for legal reforms with groups like um equality now and uh the web Foundation um also the the slides um the organizers are able to share it with you you and what I want us to do is to be able to create movements that will create changes and break barriers and that's my call to action for today and going forward um also I really want us to mobilize Community groups every Community usually has as a women's group a lot of communities do this even in those I understand we live in a patriarchal society I understand that we have cultural barriers but if we do not take that step it's going to be extremely hard for us to see change so on our end in terms of Nuru and the kind of work that we do and we urge you to partner with us as well we engage uh with um in a lot of uh csw consultations um with the one that is currently happening right now um in New York we've been in um in consultations with Beijing on Beijing um plus 30 as many of you are aware that this is the 30th year since um since since this was put um in place the framework uh we also participate uh on the 16 days of activism against gbv which usually starts uh November 25th all the way to December 10th um gender consultations so partnership with grassroot organizations umos we work a lot with comma as well we also work with different agencies in the government so ours we firmly believe um in advocacy we believe in awareness and we believe in taking action so this slide also has some links whereby you can get more information and just have a look at some of the initiatives um that are going on within the country within the region outside will give you um insight as to um how you can join up how you can partner what you can do for your organization in terms of uh visibility funding these are just some of the links that are able to assist you so allow me to stop there um as I know I'm out of time but yes please feel free to reach out we are always open to partnership we are we are more than open to join forces uh with the different initiatives that are happening out there and mine is to say thank you you so much thank you very much M ion for the wonderful presentation on policy influence um next in line the last but not least uh it's mumo Kori talking on mentorship and capacity building uh mumo is stepping in for Willis onyango so mumo Kori is a dedicated Advocate yes it's is a dedicated advocate for Youth Empowerment and inclusive governance evidenced by his historic candidacy as Kenya's youngest presidential aspirant back in 2022 he also contribute significantly to the development sector as a partnership associ associate at the youth Cafe uh welcome mumo and feel free to talk about mentorship and capacity building and also make it 10 minutes in to be precise kindly thank you indeed thank you very much I hope I'm quite well audible mumo Kori is my name as has been said I'm trying to step in on the big shoes of my senior and boss and Mentor Willis um while I don't have a presentation but I try to to put the best um I can out of these and I'll try to keep it 10 minutes so yes youth Cafe is a panafrican organization it is youth Le it is youth serving it has about three 3,"500 members or member organizations and about a million individual members and uh I think yeah this was the right topic for youth Cafe and uh because of time I'll just try to go through some of the few notes I've tried to put together of course gender based violence um is a global crisis and it impacts individuals and communities across all demographics as uh my previous as the one who spoke before me also my boss Mary has said one in three women experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime uh by an intimate partner or so but to be real gbz gbv is not just a ladies only Club men also experience it uh though often you know are reported so at youth Cafe we try to approach it from that angle that uh as we talking to the youth we try not to divide them you know men and women and we try to show them that uh gbv really is a human issue so we should look at it as that but uh going to context uh what what are the importance of Youth Le Movement Like youth Cafe I know we say that young people are not just the future they are the now and thus um they have unique perspectives energy and especially tech tech tech Sav is crucial in creating impactful change but what are the specific importances um of Youth lab movement and why should they be sustained uh to add and help how can they help NG gbv first is the direct access and the peer influence uh and of course young people can reach their peers in way adults cannot and can even have discussions that it's not easily done with adults they speak the same language they say that they are tribess they speak the same language they understand uh same social media trends and navigate some you know online spaces they are online and all that and and thus youth Le movements are very important in a way that they can reach uh so many spaces that even adults cannot reach and you know that youth is an intermediary intermediate between the adults and the children of course um importantly is Innovation and adaptability and you know young people are inherent are inherently Innovative um and adaptable they are quick to embrace new technologies and find Creative Solutions to complex problems um of course the third one U is long-term sustainability um and investing in these um youth Le movements and youth Le csos cbos and all that ensures that the fight against gbv continues for Generations these are young people they have energy they have time they have you know they have more time and if the the culture of ending ending gbv and living together you know as humans Humanity humanity is very key as we speak about this if if young people can really um Embrace Humanity living together embracing each other I think it can be really have it can really have long-term sustainability challenging social norms I think young people really don't care about the traditional and all these things they're more likely to challenge harmful social norms of course and stereotypes that perpetrate you know gender based violence so quite an important why why we should even support young youth Le and youth serving and you know youth Cafe is youth Le and youth serving Grassroots mobilization much as there's a lot of um ation to urban areas by the young people most of them are in the know in the Grassroots and they are good mobilizers they have energy and for youth Cafe we have really benefited from this because sometimes young people um you know are press to the corn and sometimes they they're willing even to volunteer of course we try to compensate them you know much as we can but young people also understand the local context and they can tailor their interventions to meet specific needs they able to easily tailor because these are their mothers their brothers their sisters in The Villages and you know they have lived with them in the because young people maybe just have left high school so they were in the rural areas and The Villages most of the time uh real world impact um and of course this is not just a theory it has been seen that Youth and Young People their leadership is producing real world results and at youth Cafe um we we Lobby the implementation of safer you know public engagement with the young people in the cities in the rural and in the in the urban areas uh and and as I've said once again we really try to rever and push our discussions in the angle of humanity and that um we can live together in harmony without undermining this is you know is a woman there's a man there's a young man there's a young woman finally uh the role or mentorship uh and and and the key actors of course mentorship is generally about guidance and one of the role is guidance and support and when you have you know like personally I'm a agenda inclusion facility I I recently trained with International ideas and un women I was training young African women on how to engage and sustain engagements with men and boys and my mentor is uh the CEO of mascul masculinity so we need mentors for guidance and support and sometimes you know I'm brought up in a very patriarchal society so sometimes I almost forget that I'm a he for she and I'm a male Ally but he always reminds me because he's my mentor and even now I'm sure he's listening and and and I'm sure if I say something that is not in accordance after he's called Ken he's a Ed executive director masculinity and and and I can attest the importance of our mental I don't want to overemphasize on that but the first one is guidance and support the the second one is knowledge transfer we don't need with a mentor you do not reinvent the whe and that's what we do at youth Cafe we match people we match young people with mentors on various angles of course our our key areas our thematic areas are democracy human rights and governance education research and Social Services economic growth health and well Agriculture and environmental sustainability talent development and Leadership and in all these spheres we bring about you know genda uh gender issues crossboard not uh gender as women or gender as men we try to bring the equality and the equity uh because as we see at youth Cafe if women empowerment or even Boy Child empowerment is is not based on impact it's based on say equality then it is posted to bring a threat and it is seen as a competition and you know in every competition there's definitely a winner and you know perhaps the one who is more mascular might end up winning so why not address it you as a human issue you know and based on impact I remind people that no one knows about the marriage and all that about wangari ma people remember about the impacts so let's really leverage on impacts closer to conclusion um so we have said about knowledge transfer no we don't reinvent the wheel with a mentor emotional support uh your Mentor can really you know step in when need be and they provide a safe space especially for young leaders to discuss challenges build resilience and maintain motivation of course networking opportunities um I have personally been mentored by my the speak the speaker who spoke before me mar your daughter and I can tell you some doors that I might need a lot of energy to knock she just needs a call or even a chat to have them you know open my boss Willies so networking opportunities is you know is one of the key role of a me Mentor they can open they can help open doors that would not easily be opened where are they not them and they connect young Leaders with varable resources and networks expanding their reach and influence um of course key actors you know HTH Cafe is one of the mentors um as a panafrican organization and organizations can become members we have recently started uh a Leadership Academy and uh and um incubation Hub so indeed if you have issues with managing um if you have issues managing your organization or you just starting your organization youth Cafe can incubate you we have a library with all the books you would want in the world you know written we have an e library and a physical Library so yes youth Cafe is one of the mentors that I can really recommend that you can check their website and a lot of a lot of um resources in there of course our boss Willis um is also one of the other mentors I know and I would also recommend young people please get in touch with Mar OD the one who just spoke just even get her number look at what she post on her social medias even her own WhatsApp status it is more informative than even every any call you go opportunities events and all that um yes and I I I think I I I can add at that but what are globally tested practices social Norm campaign I think a lot of them have been spoken about um so I I would want to stop at that because of time but uh what are who are the actors we really need to you know to push other than youth Le organizations you know the government we need to push P the government to really invest on um um to push the government to invest on youth Le initiatives create support this is another way of you know reducing Unemployment uh create supportive policies and ensure meaningful you participation in decision making processes of course Civil Society organization like Nuru like ourselves like yourselves the organizers and thank you very much for this space um of course prioritize mentorship program I mean I I I I founded the young aspirants and aspiring leaders Network because I'm a former aspirant and I was in depression uh and and I know I was mentored to volunteer to kipa in the last history and today um a youth Advisory Board member with the European partnership for democracy out of mentorship so let's prioritize mentorship it's not always about allowances and you know uh capacity building of course it's a form of mentorship but goes a long with direct mentorship even just talking to to young people on networks where can they fight grants opportunities and all these and also let's provide resources and training of course um to the funders the funders also should also really focus on young people they do not have very solid ideas and um organizations but they have impactful projects that can be supported like at um young aspirants and aspiring leaders uh we are they partnering with youth Cafe because we asking ourselves only one person is elected in every election and there are more than 10 aspirants most of them who are young so where do all the others who fail go they're back in the Villages and everyone who dare to buy has you know an impact project they can do at their Village level perhaps they're not able to package it and all that uh so funders should really look into how you know otherwise the same organization will keep on getting these grants and all that uh of course individuals to volunteer and finally to the youth actively participating movements seek mentorship and utilize your voices I Al I always tell my young people that the first rule of inclusion is showing up thank you very much that was mumo Kori I hope I have tried to fit in my boss shoes H thank you very much for this opportunity and I'm here for any question thank you thank you very much uh mumo I'm sure you tried to fit in your B's shoes H so that has come to that is an end of our presentation from the speakers thank you for each and every speaker for sharing your good Insight on gender based violence it has been an absolutely wonderful and dudic session I am sure everyone joined in is going home with something in the bank something positive and to drive change back where they are coming from or where they are going to uh the next session I'll open up for anyone who has questions uh I think it will take because of time it will take five to six minutes to take three around three questions and any of the speakers can answer any questions you can type in the chat or raise your hand thank you I can see we have one question from Catherine uh the question is how youth serving organizations ccreate and enhance Synergy to maximize impact as opposed to replicating initiatives any speaker can just answer that question kindly or rather we can have Mary to answer it since she's in that space actually I wanted to ask um if I can respond to that one so there are lots of ways um that I think can be can be utilized um when it comes to synergizing efforts let me speak on um two right now one is uh by creating strategic Partnerships and complimenting each other's strengths so as Muma has said um I also engage quite a bit with the youth Cafe this guys have a presence literally across Africa and if I'm not wrong Moo can correct me I think his Cafe has um uh you guys have a presence in 36 countries right now looking at um the space that they in how they engage with young people the different Avenues Nuru on this other end as we are mostly in the demography that um which organization can uh take up the the digital space which organization can pick up on the entrepreneurship space now depending on the kind of work that we want to do um and the kind of um intervention that we are pursuing also um in the same breath maybe y Cafe is better at fundraising and us on this other end we are better with donor engagement so you have a look at the um at the particular um strengths that one organization has um and the partner that you want to um Embark the journey or the project with and now you see how you can pair up and one thing I also want to highlight uh We've also seen what the funding Trends are looking like at the moment so creating collisions creating Partnerships that's one of the key ways especially with youth Le organizations to be able to enter into different spaces um to be able to pursue do certain activities so just create strategic Partnerships go online have a look at um I want to carry out a project um in kifi who's on the ground this is what I want to do um let me reach out to them and I'll see how can we align the kind of uh e sorry I think I got disconnected uh can you hear me yes we lost you for a moment oh sorry uh sorry about that I think it's the network uh so yeah so just to wrap this up um have have have a look at um your partners so be strategic in terms of choosing Partners complement your strengths share your resources um um and uh the last thing that I can say is have joint advocacy to influence policy that way you end up strengthening your projects and the work that you want to do thank you very much Mary uh what I can I can get from that is we need to collaborate together from different organization different ngos you can just come together and do things partner and do things so that we don't have replication of the same same thing and focus on the impact um I can see in the chat we have another question from Kennedy take the concept of Youth Cafe as an initiative what are some of the ideas we can use to reach to reach the youth such as border border on issues of gbv these people have a lot of Intelligence on the threat of violence even before it happened so yeah the question is how can we reach the youth such as border borders on issue border border guys on issues of gbv um I think that question can be answered from Miku from youth Cafe um indeed um what we're doing at youth Cafe we also work with bab and they have the Bab Association of Kenya and I'll tell you we had a discussion one day I'm trying to speak in lowon and you know they told us that they know uh how if they get broke they even know who they can blackmail and they can get money instantly because they know who who which man goes to whose wife what time and the other way or which Man visits which other man's wife but yes as you're saying can indeed they have a lot of intelligence these people are at the very grassroot level and we also trying to engage them through um through the the border border movement and we are trying to to implement a concept on why Patriots must support women and by women we mean their mothers their sisters their wives their daughters and and and you know a very classical example assume a man and you do not Empower your sister or your mother or whoever and in today's cruel world you die you know before your children finish school so if you have not empowered your you know your wife and all that so we want to do this with Buddha buha people because budha buha people they they can easily they young and most of them are young they can easily Cascade this information downwards and and because we want to show Patriots that have said that I've brought up in a very patriarchal society in liia that indeed women empowerment has more to do with impacts than the perceived competition so the question was on how we can engage Buddha buddas but uh the best way to engage Buddha boers is a position value for them most of them do not have driving license like partner with ntsa to go and train them on or even help them get driving licenses some of them do not have reflectors they're not very expensive just go with some resource to the b b guys and if you do that uh definitely you're able to to capture their attention and also get value information of course others is train them on safety Partnerships information and education um and such I hope I tried to respond okay thank you very much Miku for sure where value is people tend to come uh so we have another question from Jeremiah uh how do cultural norms and values within the community influence attitudes toward gender based violence and what efforts and followups are being made to challenge armful belief uh that question could be answered by our first Speaker Pascal thank you so much um Jeremiah for your question H first thing I love to say is that this conversation needs to start in our in our dinner table I have given you guys an example of my parents for example they are they tend to believe that no man can hit you just because they like hitting people you ought to have done something to provoke him we need to start having these conversations at the dinner table because if you take this conversation to schools or to universities you best you better believe that people in schools and universities are very receptive of this message you know we need to start this conversation at home in our houses before we can even escalate them outside and some of the ways that um culture influences or attributes towards GB is the patriarchal structures for example many societies uphold male dominance and they believe that men have authority over women including control and how do they assert this control through violence another cultural norm is for example victim blaming some cultures stigmatize survivors and they make it difficult for them to speak up or to seek Justice there's harmful Traditions like um child marriage FGM or Widow inheritance and these cultural practices reinforce gender inequalities and Expos women and girls to gbv I am AIS and where I come from I'm not saying all KES but I'll just give an my own life experience where I come from things like if GM are like breathing oygen you close school over the December holiday and you're taken to shs they they FGM you and then you come back to Nairobi uh and even child marriages you know things like that and there people who still believe that if you get somebody a woman has been circumcised they will make a good wife so sometimes you don't even have to go back to school once you have he you go to your husband house there's there's um things like taboo for example discussing gbv in some places shame don't even don't even so what efforts can use to challenge to some we can start with Community Le conversations we can organize traditional we can organize convers that bring together traditional and religious leaders to just re interpret cultural belief in a way that reject violence and they promote gender equality you there are places where they want they they tell women to be submissive they will even quote for example Genesis 1 chapter 1 says to be submissive we're not saying that a woman should not submit but what does submission look like submission does submission mean if I don't do something you hit me the submission mean I only need to listen and no question asked another effort would be legal reforms and policy enforcement advoc advocacy groups even us youth can push for stricter laws and better enforcement and we should we can also in that way ensure that the youth or the survivors get Justice and protection there's another strategy on education and awareness schools and Community programs of course they already teach about gender based violence but I will continue to insist that this conversations can start in our own homes let us involve our parents let us involve our brothers our brothers who have grown up seeing our moms being hait by our fathers do not need to continue doing that let us start having that conversation at home we need to also engage men and boys we need to promote to to come up with programs that promote positive masculinity that that encourages men to be in ending gbv rather than perpetrators we can also use media digital campaign social media radio TV I know Jes some do not listen to radio but I know we very heavy users of social media we can use that to challenge stereotypes and to promote gender to to promote survival centered narratives we can use support systems and safe spaces we can create more shelters or counseling centers and come up with reporting mechanisms that are that are being set up to support survivors and to break the cycle in terms of followup as as I conclude we can come up with monitoring and evaluation um strategies we can assess the effectiveness of the awareness campaigns and the interventions that we put out there we can review the policies that we have tried to implement can we track the laws against gbv and how they being enforced and we push for accountability there's also Community feedback and engagement we can do intergenerational dialogues with the leaders religious leaders or political leaders after some time to just assess whether these are strategies are making sense and if they're not they're not castom Stone we can always review revamp and improve and lastly and a final thought we can also um Empower programs for survivors we can come up with empowerment programs for survivors I have mentioned before that there are safe houses and in this safe houses it's one thing to keep the lights on it's another thing to also Empower this women so that even after this woman has come out of this safe house because will not be there forever she does not go back to her husband's house and she also has a way of making money for her for herself to just do things her own and even in this empowerment programs we can also look at the mental health aspect as well because even while she's in this um safe house are you also taking care of her mental health or are you just concerned about what she's going to eat and where she's going to sleep and finally finally as I mute myself is that cultural norms can be changed can always be changed it only requires persistent advocacy persistent education and persistent collaboration at all levels be it grassroot or national or Global I thought I hope that answers your question Jeremiah and thank you yes thank you for that Insight pascala uh I can see we have a question on okay let let me read it what do you think content such as the viral sopia and bumpy episode on Julia G's podcast So This is Love what do you think such content does for the gbv conversation especially with regard to advocacy and policy creation uh I don't know if Javan you've heard the podcast but since you're in that space of digital activism I'd like you to answer that question in less than one minute kindly Jaan can I give a quick response as we get ja Cafe here yeah sure less than a minute kindly you can attest I'm a eke keeper I think it raises awareness but most importantly it Sparks a dialogue um as it appears to generate considerable discussion online um I think it also tries to challenge Norms but more I hope it achieve this um you know to influence policy and it's increased awareness and public dialogue I think for me those are the four things that would that comes closer to my mind when I think about it thank you okay thank you very much I can see Javan is not in a position to give his Insight but thank you Miku that was very well H so we are coming to the end of today's been it has been a good ride with everyone here thank you for making time to join in and educate ourselves on matters gender based violence so I'll give each speaker uh a minimum of 30 seconds and when I say 30 seconds I mean 30 seconds uh to make a parting short something small to the audience before we close uh we can start with um we can start with less than a minute then we go to jav okay I think Java be able to talk then you can go to Mary and lastly mumo less than a minute gu I thank you okay thank you I don't know why you always have to start with me but it's okay don't mind my closing remarks um ending gender based violence starts with me basaria ending start violence against women starts with you culture should not be an excuse for her it should not never and we can always challenge these harmful Norms we can always amplify Survivor voices and we can always create safer communities let us keep this conversation going so that we don't have it today as much as I do not want to keep talking about gbv I want it to be a things of the past I want us to if we hear gbv we have to look that up in the dictionary we just need to take charge we need to take action and create the change that we want to see thank you maybe oh sorry I thought um joh was going next um my parting shot would be let's not get tired we are our ancestors wildest dreams we are changing the landscape we are changing in what the future will look like for the next Generation that comes in and I believe we've been given such a gift that uh we're meeting on such a platform and our voices can go beyond Kenya Beyond boundaries so let us be the ones to make our grandparents proud let us be the ones to make our children proud of what we have done so don't get tired don't give up keep talking keep showing up and I know change will take place thank you um thank you very much and on behalf of the youth Cafe fraternity I say thank you for this opportunity my parting short of course to

PjBFiKOOGU8,Why violence against women is a men39s issue  FRANCE 24 English,2025-03-28T16:16:37Z,UCQfwfsi5VrQ8yKZ-UWmAEFg,gender violence,US,32,656,12,The option for divorce was first legalized in California in 1969 Since then globally MORE women requested a divorce than men Speaks volumes on whos the real problem   This has been discussed for years I think the window of opportunity to make a difference has closed Turning the ship around would take a lot of investment  Is hatred against men a women issue as well Were seeing a lot of that from the movements that ask us to do them service  I not sure about this view there are female killers too and female abusers too and domestic abuse and violence by females so shouldnt it just be killers  and abusers are wrong,[Music] hello I'm Anette young and welcome to the 51 percentage show about women reshaping our world in this special edition we're focusing on misogyny especially among boys and young men this is the Netflix adolescent Series has gone viral a harrowing British drama about a young boy accused of killing a female our classmate it's garnered rave reviews for its performances and storyline yet its most important Legacy could be kickstarting societal change and opening up a much needed conversation on toxic masculinity now in a moment I'll be talking to Dr Jackson Katz a specialist in gender violence and whose book entitled every man how violence against women is a men's issue has just been published but first Jennifer Ben Brahim tells us why adolescence is Making Waves a British family's World falls apart you're making a big mistake as their 13-year-old son is arrested dad I haven't done anything accused of having murdered his female classmate Netflix's four-part series adolescence is a fictional Tale steeped in reality I'm going to start off with asking you do you know a girl called Katie Leonard and I've seen an incident on the Telly again where there was like quite a few young boys who stabbed young girls and taken their life uh and if I'm really honest with you it hurt my heart do you know what I mean and it instantly made me think what's going on with Society with this kind of things happening from a fatal stabbing of 12-year-old Ava white in 2021 to the crossbow killer Kyle Clifford who searched online for misogynistic podcasts just hours before murdering his ex-girlfriend as well as a Southport murderer deliberately targeting young girls leading to some of the worst unrest in the country in over a decade adolescence examines the devastating and sometimes fatal consequences of toxic masculinity 80% of women are attracted to 20% of men you must trick them cuz you'll never get them in a normal way statistics show that the number of women killed injured or threatened by a knife in the UK has more than doubled in a 5-year period to the alarm of UK MPS this violence carried out by young men influenced by what they see online is a real um problem it's a poent um and we have to tackle it a call to action to show Adolescence in Parliament and in schools and a rousing speech by England Football manager sir Gareth Southgate calling for better male role models this as more and more boys and young men turn to influencers like the self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate or social media platforms promot voting in cell culture you look at what the women's movement has done we have empowered women we can talk about our emotions we have very tight-knit communities but there isn't that kind of cultural information and support for young boys and so into this void the only people who step forward are people on the far right and in the manosphere like Andrew Tate and ostensibly what he offers is is what young boys want they want to be told how to be men basically down to you need to become very fit you need to invest in cryptocurrency and you need to blame any problems in your life on wokery and women there was a recent report saying that teenage boys and more likely to have a smartphone than have a father in their houses and even if you're in single parent family you don't have a father there we need to make sure our communities have support for boys adolescence launched the week that the UK put into action its Online safety act platforms like Instagram and Tik Tok must Safeguard against harmful content or face a fine a survey by the UK's children's commissioner found that half of the 13-year-old surveyed had reported seeing hardcore misogynistic pornographic material on social media joining me now from Boston is Dr Jackson cats a gender violence specialist and author of every man how violence against women is a men's issue thank you so much for your time Jackson as we saw there the Netflix series adolesence has uh caused an incredible Buzz reminding us that toxic masculinity is much more of an issue for young boys as it is for men why does this show resonate so much um I think this is an incredible cultural moment globally because of the the power of the storytelling its brilliant televisual art the adolescence series but what it does is it really looks at a boy and his family and the influences on boys and young men that come from the online you know manosphere although it doesn't really foreground the manosphere it's always there in the backdrop and it gives us an opportunity to talk about um the ways in which misogyny and men's violence against women is being driven by sort of beliefs about manhood that are being shaped in part through the online universe that so many boys and young men inhabit and it also focuses on in in in the storyline the father both both parents of the boy who was who murdered this young woman but um but but the father and his failings feelings of failure for having um failed to protect his son from these influences that he wasn't aware of so it gives us an opportunity to talk about the role of adult men in the life of of boys but just more generally it gives us an opportunity to talk about uh adult men's responsibility to boys and girls in this cultural moment so why have we been so slow to understand the impact of online radicalization of boys well it's very disturbing topic I mean I think there's some generational divide because I think a lot of uh older folks or you know over the age of 45 I'm me just using that as a rough cut off um who haven't grown up with this the the technology of communication the online Universe more generally and obviously the manosphere which has increased its its reach over the last decade or so it went from a the corner of the of the of the internet a dark corner of the internet to becoming much more mainstream over the past decade which coincided not coincidentally with um the rise of Donald Trump and right-wing populism and Andrew Tate's emergence as a global figure so I think a lot of older folks um and I include myself in this in this category have been a little bit more hands-off and thinking you know well you know there's some stuff that I don't really like but they're not really aware of what's happening and I think partly what what has happened as a result of the success of this show adolescence is that some of the you know some of the parents and older uh folks who haven't been paying close attention are now paying attention and your book is entitled every man and it really is a call to every man yet why do so many men constantly fail to understand the need to flip the script when it comes to violence against women and girls that the onus is on them not women uh to solve the problem well I think I think a lot of men are really M uh uneasy and and and anxious about this subject matter about feminism about talking about the the gender culture and the changes that have been happening over the past couple of generations I think there are some men who are happy to have that conversation who are engaged in that conversation but I think a lot of men are very nervous and what they do is as a result of their anxiety and their their lack of fluency with this and and and had language to use to talk about this subject they they remain silent or they defer to women and I think they Outsource a lot of the conversation about gender and sexuality and relationships especially with young people including young men they Outsource that conversation to women whether it's mothers or or other women in the public conversation and I don't I don't think it's because a lot of men don't care I just think a lot of men are have feelings of inadequacy they don't know what to say honestly inette I see men who are extraordinarily articulate and Powerful on so many other issues and they can speak thoughtfully about so many other issues but when it comes to issues relating to gender sexuality feminist uh critiques of traditional gender ideologies and gender beliefs and and roles I think a lot of those men become um extremely inarticulate and so they Retreat and the the the lack of doing that or the failure to do that has caused a crisis and there's so many young men who are who are a drift today and who are easily manipulated by people like Andrew Tade or political figures like Donald Trump and others who can exploit that um feeling of of of longing and and and and loss and some sort of loneliness epidemic among young men and for their own political or or economic gain in your book Jackson you also recommend men should stop watching pornography as it legitimizes misogynist abuse by normalizing sexualized brutality but is that realistic well whether it's realistic or not I think we need to do it because if we if we're going to be if we're serious about reducing the the global crisis of sexual violence and sexual harassment um to we have to address the way in which pornography and the misogyny in pornography normalizes a certain kind of sexual satus and cruelty and I'm not saying this isn't anti-sex it's not anti-sex to critique pornography so I'm I I don't I want to dissociate myself from any notion that it's it's it's against sexual Freedom or Liberation to critique pornography the misogyny that has been so normalized in porn is a big part of the problem and and I don't think it's going to go away tomorrow but I do think we have to open up lines of communication and discussion about it and I do think that adult men need to be part of that conversation we can't just Outsource this one to women it goes beyond doesn't it regulating social media platforms or Banning smartphones under the ages of 16 which we're already starting to see in Australia I mean it's about the need for a complete rewiring if you like of cultural values where men understand that their emotional connection is the key to successful relationships with women and not control so how do you get that message across it's a it's a great it's huge wakeup call that while we've been definitely in a positive way advancing women and and promoting girls and women's opportunities in a multi-racial multi-ethnic sense I think I think we have to pay more attention to Bringing men along and bringing young men along into the conversation into the reading I think there's a real disconnect between young men for example and young women's engagement with feminist ideas with taking courses at University or or reading books or engaging in in in dialogue about this subject matter and I think a lot of young men don't even understand that you can be a strong man and be a and be feminist conscious or Pro feminist that you can support gender equality and support boys and men they I think a lot of young men have a very limited understanding of these issues and I think that's on those of us who are adults to to we need to counteract that because again the status quo um is screaming at us that we're not doing a good enough job and the same applies to boys as well doesn't it of course but boys boys take the lead from adults you know so I mean I mean we can't expect boys to be the ones who who are the leaders of the change that has to happen um I think adult men are the ones who have to bring up the conversations we have to initiate dialogue if those those of us who are in a who have a platform of influence beyond our role as parents and I'm a parent of a son I I have a responsibility as a father Yes but I also responsibility as a person who's an educator who's in public and I think adult men in position of influence cultural in influence uh you know religious Authority even but certainly in the media and the sports culture I mean there's so many adult men who are good people but they have not been active and present and meeting the moment when it comes to gender equity and gender violence prevention and the time is now I'm afraid we're going to have to leave it there thank you so much for your time Jackson thank you very much andette it's been great to be with you and that's it for this Edition so until our next show bye for now

ZJAOApcT20E,How Does Caste Conflict Fuel Gendered Violence  Feminism in India,2025-03-28T11:30:30Z,UCh9Z5tOOo7D3Jb22K6gItHQ,gender violence,IN,8,52,1,,"india a country with more than a billion people has a rigid hierarchical social system that is the cast system where the upper class that is brahinss sit at the top while the lowered casts that is the dalits and the adivasis are placed at the bottom this hierarchy has been part of the social moral and economic landscape of the country for centuries creating an awful space for the larger cast conflict gas conflict is an epidemic that comes from the longstanding discrimination and violence experienced by Dalits who are seen as the lowest in the hierarchy and the brahinss were the most privileged but today we're not here to talk about the history of cast or cast systems we are here to look into how cast can act or manifest as a conflict between various groups of people exacerbating the violence against the already oppressed class of women it is to be noted that cast conflict is quite peculiar to India and is more prevalent among Hindus but it is also practiced by other religions like Sikhism Islam and Christianity among others so welcome to another episode of gendering conflict war on women and others in this episode we look into how cast acts as a source of conflict and exacerbates the violence against women not long ago in 2016 a horrific tragedy unfolded in the small village of Keralangji Maharashtra four members of the Bat Manga community a Dalith community were brutally massacred in an act of extreme violence this was not just an isolated incident it was a chilling reminder of the deeprooted cast-based discrimination that persists in our society the perpetrators of this massacre were from the numerically dominant Kundi cast and the violence sparked because of a land conflict between the two communities but the dispute wasn't just a conflict over land it was a manifestation of the larger cast system that defines who gets to own who gets to work and who is considered worthy the tragedy of Keralangji massacre is not only just the loss of life it is the system that allows such violence to occur with impunity theits who have fought for centuries for their rights continue to suffer from cast based violence even today in silence in 2010 in Miripur several houses of the Walmiki community were torched down by uppercas js over a trivial incident as a result two people from the Walmiki community were killed in the aftermath about 200 families left the [Music] village but it doesn't stop here women continue to face physical psychological sexual violence from the male massochists and those who uphold the brahmanical patriarchy it's all about showing power and keeping those systems of patriarchy in place women from lower casts are seen as the perfect targets for them they don't quite fit into their ideal of cast and because of their gender often face more violations and oppression over the years countless cases of castbased violence against women have emerged yet the voices of these victims often go unheard their cries for justice fading into silence one such tragic case that grabbed national attention was the Hathrus gang rape in 2020 in Hathras Uttar Pradesh a young woman from Dalith community faced unspeakable violence from the hands of upperccast men four uppercass men brutally gang raped her an act not only fueled by the gender but also the cast she suffered immense physical injuries and finally succumbed to the wounds but her ordeal did not end that day according to the newsre quote years after the young woman's death three of the accused are back to the village and living as neighbors to her family meanwhile her own family continues to live a life of captivity caged inside their own home."" This is not an isolated incident that needs our attention quote in Lakshmanpurbath Bihar women were raped and mutilated before being massacred by members of the Ranir Zena in 1997 in Bihar and in Tamil Nadu women have been beaten arrested and sometimes tortured during violent search and raid operations on Dalith villages in recent years Dalith women have also been arrested and raped in custody as means of punishing their male relatives who are hiding from the police as very young women they are forced into prostitution in temples under the Dasi system unquote states human rights watch if we look at the recent crisis in Manipur we find that beneath the surface lies a painful and complex issue one that interwines cast and gender at the heart of the violence are the dominant matey community and the marginalized cookie tribe this castbased conflict has led to horrific acts of violence particularly against women it is the most heartbreaking news that to hear the news of the woman and child killings and it is a terrorist act it is a criminal act and it is against the humanity women's wear wrapped with more than more than I cannot name them i cannot number them the brutality of these acts highlight the intersection of cast and gender- based violence these women were not only targeted because of their gender but because of their position as lowerass individuals within the hierarchy of power and control but as I always say women fight back and when they do they break the shackles of patriarchy and reduce this horrible system to ashes in the next and the last episode of this series we'll look into how women fight back and how they act as emissaries of peace in conflict regions so stay tuned [Music]"

emphasis will be on women and girls um be talking on the framing of gender violence and Becky be giv some examples of women who have experienced gender violence in terms of killing of women and I'll be talking on the of silencing women so as you l we believe that at the end of the session you have a you make your commitment you know to stand against gender violence of any form thank you in Niger let's just take a good look at this picture this is the Parliament House in Nigeria how many women see inure there's one at the door you know doing but see the ones making laws their hands are off deciding you know what we happen in the country let's go to the next one now before we focus on Nigeria let's do a global reflection how many women are currently in your country's Parliament or your Senate you might want to let's see the numbers to know how many women are actually actively participating in politics in your country how many how many in Japan 10% 10% in Japan same with India 133% Korea okay in Nepal U we have like 33% of guaranteed proportionate representation in the parliament is making this St but we still don't have okay let's let's move on now um for this let's look at this part first between October 2004 and October 2024 the blue one represents 2004 and the orange one repres 24 so between 2004 and 2024 that's like 20 years difference so between 20 years he moved for Middle East and North Africa it moves by just 10% in Asia it moves less than 10% in the Pacific L 10% in Subs Africa 13% in Europe about 15% and in America let's say 12% that's 20 years has come and gone and in women representation in politics we still have low numbers and I saw this today and it was very fascinating he said did you know Namibia is the only country in the entire world where women occupy the top three highest government positions so I went onine I to dig deep about these three women she is the president of Namibia she's the vice president and she's the U Senate President the House of Assembly and you can see progress in namibia's economy let's move to the next SL now according to the National Democratic Institute violence against women in politics encompasses all forms of aggression I put it in both coion and intimidation against women as political actors because simply because they are women just because they are women nobody looks at their certifications how good they are can they really be good leaders just because you a woman the society frames you as not worthy of leading the nation and this asther directed that women as civil society leaders voters I I read online that there are still some countries where women are not allowed to participate in electoral processes women are not allowed to vote it's just the men that vote in these countries there are not even political party members candidates elected representative or appointed officials you know are designed to restrict the political participation of women as a group let's now this is key fact about women I got some of them from the UN women um website and says 44% of sured women across 39 countries reported death rape assault or abduction threats and for this women this 44% of women these are women who even manage to get into politics when they get into that space these are some things that they face women in public life are at greater risk of being objectified of course Society views women as weaker vus there you know the men it's meant for the men and women are held to more exacting and frequently higher standards than their male competitors by voters Community leaders and political opinion leaders so if these women eventually get into politics and they make just a mistake the whole world will start crying that oh this is why we don't want women to be in politics in the first place look at what she did she can't be they use negative words her she can't keep a home and all of those things and democracy cannot be said to exist if half of the population is not holy and equally engaged in decision making and like I showed us in the previous Slide the 2024 report no country in the world has 50% of their women in politics no country in the world no country in the world and I'm I'm still going to talk about the sdds as5 for gender equality and they want gender equality to be achieved by 20130 and for 20 years we've not achieved anything so globally women legislators report experiencing violence at nearly double the rate of men so a question for us what would democracy look like if more women were leaders I just want our opinion if more women go into leadership you know political leadership what do we think that our countes would look like because personally I feel like a woman who can carry another human being inside of her obviously knows how to care you know that motherly you see that motherly you know love that she gives to us how much more when she begins to lead a nation and she begins to lead people I feel like you have something to say I feel depend on who is president and other leaders for example in my country the Prime Minister the Vice President are both women just the of the president so all the other can come into the societ toig maybe achieve the gend equality that we looking for is it I think it it would also mean like a symbol like for younger people like more than a change on policies or government itself sometimes people being on the top H can be a symbol for especially younger women that may think that is possible because if you are a young women and maybe you look that all the politics are always men then you might think it's not possible even if people say so don't go back to your countries to change something nothing will change and we keep repeating the same Circle over and over again please next now relating to the magic mod because I had to think through looking at everything that we've done so far it deeply resonates with feminist political discuss on how petal institution weaponize exclusion and intimidation to supress female political agency like she was saying they want to silence her by all means they took away our cars our security everything just so that she keeps quiet so as story represents the intersection of gender power and resistance the men who have power do not want her to speak and I mean I already touched on sustainable development goals and I don't know what they doing let's move now towards change what can we do naming the violence is the first step towards dismantling it we first have to know that there is violence in the first place secondly talking about this in academic and policy spaces pushes back against normalized exclusion because like I said our society everybody has normalized it that oh women are not supposed to be in politics it's not a good space to be but when we begin to talk about this in Academia you know in policy development spaces who get the desired change and we must invest in Civic and Leadership education for girls and young women to see that oh yes before I came to the UK there was a un funded project um and the Canada government that was a part of to get more girls and women into you know politics if we can get more of that and strengthen legals and enforce penalties for political violence till now the senator the Senate President has not been dealt with he's still on his seat nothing has been done and must Foster inclusive party systems with gender quter promote media accountability and digital safety for women in public life encourage mentorship and solidarity networks we hope with this scorion of us you been inspired to you know stand up against gender violence and before we close we have like final set of questions forence from J [Music]

and then we're going to um give you some information about how survivors of gender- based violence are criminalized um and how course of control and litigation abuse play into that as well and how we're hope how the project is hoping to address the criminalization of gender-based survivors so the next slide is the introduction and um the goal of the project is to address the disproportionate impact of the law on women and gender diverse people who identify violence against them particularly intimate partner violence and sexual violence but then find themselves facing criminal and other consequences and also scaling up promising practices from the clinic criminalization of women program and this project is a 30month project ending in March 2026 we began the project in January 2024 and the project has uh the community engagement lawyer kalandra is the project lawyer and the national project coordinator myself I am Rosa uh I'm the project coordinator and um it is a national project the location we have Edmonton and Toronto GTA Montreal and Halifax okay so um we'd hope to give you a primer today on how survivors are criminalized so um to begin I'd like to share a little bit about our criminalization of women project which is the catalyst for this project for the criminalization of survivorship and survivorship project so the criminalization of women project started around 2018 and it was um kind of the brainchild of one of our um dear colleagues who's worked at the clinic for many many years Paula Alves who noticed that survivors were coming to the clinic and they were being charged with criminal charges um for things like assault assault with a weapon or other things um in that they engaged in um usually as a as a point of self-defense or retaliatory violence um or reactive violence um so um her noticing this trend led to her telling our executive director Deepa Matu that um you know this really needs to be addressed we have no services for these gender- based violence survivors who are experiencing this and I would really like to see something at the clinic that would help survivors navigate their criminal charges so the um the way we've seen at the clinic um gender- based violence survivors be charged is in several different ways the first is in family law um and and with mandatory charging policies so um mandatory charging policies were I think established in the 80s um and the hope of lawmakers at that time advocates at the time was that um in introducing mandatory charging policies for domestic violence or intimate partner violence that more people would actually end up getting charged more perpetrators or or people that harm would would get charged unfortunately what we've seen is an unintended consequences of the mandatory charging policies where police have to charge someone when there is a domestic violence call um that survivors sometimes are inappropriately charged and this can be because police rely on intimate or inaccurate information about their part from their partners and they may focus on individual instances of violence instead of recognizing the ongoing patterns of violence in the relationship um or the course of control and litigation abuse in the relationship which we'll get to um and sometimes police also don't recognize survivors using violence as a form of self-defense that they don't recognize them actually being survivors um and then in the family law context survivors are increasingly being charged in relation to um continued contact with abusers required by custody orders so one thing that's really difficult in um when survivors are charged with assault or um another criminal offense related to intimate partner violence is that um sorry I lost my words there is is what we're seeing is is that they they automatically get a no contact order um and a no contact order means that they can't contact their spouse um for for while um the criminal charges are being played out in court so um this can go directly against custody orders in family law um and can go against um parenting time in family law um and can make it really difficult to navigate parenting time and decision- making um when there's a no contact order in place and so often times we see that the criminal no contact order goes against whatever the family law orders is and then the person has to go through another separate step of getting bail variation in order to um in order to deal with the to be able to speak to their their spouse about their children um or if they don't do that and they do just continue contacting the spouse they are very at risk of of being charged with a separate charge which is failure to comply um with the court order of the no contact order so we see um in family law that that being an issue and also um with contempt orders in family law is another way that um survivors can be criminalized if they're not wanting to provide or not following court orders to provide parenting time or in decision-m because of the abuse um that is not being recognized by the court um that can be another way that through family law that survivors are criminalized next slide please and in sexual assault law survivors can be charged when um their asalent alleges to the police that the survivor was actually the one who assaulted or sexually assaulted them um and also survivors can be charged or threatened to be charged if the police do not believe their statement they can be charged with giving a false report to the police so um there's also ways in sexual assault law that we see survivors being charged um and um it makes it really difficult we have seen cases where um the person the survivor reports the police to the police their spouse of of of intimate partner violence and then the spouse turns back on them and charges them with assault or sexual assault um this is as a retaliatory tactic to keep them um engaged with the law and to um continue to have impact on their lives next slide and in immigration and refugee law what we see is we see um survivors with precarious immigration status um they face risk of being deported or denied status if they report abuse or are criminalized um so if they're criminalized in any way um you know they their status is is very much um in Canada is very much at risk and what we see a lot with the clients that we serve here at the clinic through the criminalization of women project is um women especially um migrant women from other countries that come here are newcomers and they might be sponsored by their spouse or their spouse might have more um ability to navigate the the systems in Canada may maybe speaks more English or has had more time here in Canada and that they use that against um the survivor and that they actually report the survivor for intimate partner violence as a way to get at the to the survivor and hopefully um in their view hopefully um impact their immigration status and and their ability to stay in Canada um so we see this like especially sponsorship of spouses used as a tool by abusers to control the the survivor and keep them in in their um gambit so what we also have seen and know of is survivors of human trafficking and forced marriage who come forward experience heightened scrutiny for their criminal status um for engaging maybe engaging in criminal behaviors related to c human trafficking or um forced marriage um as well next slide please so the next one is what is cohesive control cohive control is a pattern of behavior used to dominate intimidate and manipulate another person often in intimate relationships it is not always physical but can also um be other forms of um abuse and it can it is harmful like forms of cohive control include isolation that is restricting contact with family friends or supportive network to increase dependence and also monitoring and surveillance tracking movements the partner's uh movement ments and reading their phone messages using spyw wear or constantly checking in and financial it could be financial control that would be restricting access to money controlling their spending or forcing financial dependence or the other form would be gaslighting or emotional manipulation that would be distorting reality to make the victim doubt themsself or their memories or their perception and um the other form of coercive control would be threats and intimidation using threats like physical emotional legal or their reputational to instill fear and compliances and it is regulating the everyday life controlling what the victim wears eats where they go how they behave and also sexual into pursuing or forcing unwanted sexual activity or using sex as a means of control and um if um parental alienation is part of coercive control too that could be manipulating children against the other parent or threatening custody laws and using institution or systems like misusing the legal medical or immigration system to control or discredit the victim and physical and verbal abuse included in it too using violence or de demeaning language to degrade and weaken confidence these tactics work together to strip autonomy and keep the victim trapped in a relationship and um that is um cohesive control basically in an intimate partner uh relationship the next slide yeah and just to add about how course of control can lead to criminalization um so course of control in a relationship can lead to criminalization um not necessarily all the time of intimate partner violence um we do see that happening where um you know the control can be so overwhelming and so insidious um that the survivor reacts in a way that is violent to protect um her or themselves um and um that can be a way that course of control can lead to criminalization but also course of control can lead to criminalization of other crimes aside from intimate partner violence um such as drug trafficking um fraud these sort of things where the the um the one doing harm the abuser uses course of control to get the person to to to engage in criminal acts to get the survivor to engage in criminal acts um right now it has been before the legislature but now with the election coming up we're unsure what is the future of any talks and legislation about criminalizing course of control but it is something legislators have been thinking of doing in Canada and what has already been done in places like Scotland um so um at the clinic we have taken the position and have um argued before legislators that corive control should not be criminalized um one of the reasons is that we fear just like with mandatory charging policies that um course of control will lead to survivors being criminalized if it's normalized it will lead to survivors being criminalized so um we're cognizant of the unintended consequences of such legislation and how creating more crimes could could lead to survivors being um criminalized more um also as well course of control uh could be really hard to prove in court our criminal system is really based off of individual or or individual instances of crimes and especially when it comes to assault it it focuses on individual instances of assault and whether or not an assault happens so it's really consider considered in moments of time and not patterns um and course of control is all about patterns um and is less about individual instances of control um so it can be really hard to prove in court a pattern of crime patter of sorry course of control and also we've seen criminalizing um intimate partner violence has not led to intimate partner violence subsiding right um so in adding another thing to be criminalized it's not going to lead to to course of control lessening in intimate partner relationships um and we need generally a better understanding of course of control before criminalizing it um it's it's been a newer topic in the gender-based violence sector of what course of control really is how to define it um how to recognize it and um you know it's going to take some time for both the judiciary the crown attorneys the police to be able to recognize and understand these concepts and see it happening in their files um in their cases so we need a better understanding as a society of course of control um and and how it can it can lead to um things like criminalization and also as well it should be noted that financial discrepancies between the partners can prevent survivors from hiring lawyers who have the capacity to gauge in in the complexity of course of control cases um those cases will be more complex than simple intimate partner violence cases it will require a lot of evidence um and it can be very difficult to get that evidence before the court and when there's a financial um income discrepancy between the partners um that can mean that the survivor who may have less money doesn't have the money to be able to hire a lawyer who could actually go through um the complexity of the case next slide so the next slide is what is litigation abuse litigation abuse is when perpetrators use legal t tactics to assert power and control over the survivor so litigation abuse um is someone misuse the legal system to harass intimidate or control another person um rather than to seek justice and it um examples of litigation abuse um repeatedly filing meritless lawsuit to overwhelm or punish the other party and using legal process um uh or filing excessive motions or appeal to delay proceedings or increasing cost or using legal processes to control or stalk a former partner in case of domestic violence or threatening legal action without basis to intimidate or silence someone refusing to comply with court orders to prolong conflict so these these kind of um examples are the litigation abuse and or also perpetrators can try to flip the narrative or claim partner suffers some sort of mental disorder so it's again the blaming um happens and using the tactics to uh control and um assert the power using legal systems so litigation abuse um the intention of it is often to create excessive financial burden on survivors um survivors often don't have the same access to financial resources as um the abusers the perpetrators um and the so that means that the abuser can go and hire legal counsel to delay proceedings to create um frivolous motions to um do any kind of tactics to continue the case in court and run the other party the survivor out of money to be able to afford for a lawyer to go on the case um and this can affect the legal outcomes that survivors can achieve also um not only can they create a financial burden in one case they often try to use multiple ways of litigating the issue um to um to continue the burden on the survivor the goal is to create stress and emotional tool on that can impair the survivor's judgment and expectations of the system um so they can make multip like I said they can make multiple complaints in multiple areas um what we've seen at the clinic is that they might make a family law case um they might um start a criminal law case the abuser um and and with false charges against the survivor um they may also as well try to um implicate professionals in their lives um especially in cases of where there's um children um that they may use they may make complaints about the child's psychiatrist or psychologist or or therapist um to their governing body and create another system where another way or another case in another system um that creates more stress on the survivor to address those things um like in in the goal in uh that can be with um implicating somehow the therapist saying that they're not doing their job correctly that they're not following their code of ethics um or something like this is that to get the child's um therapist changed to um impact the family law proceedings um in in when there's a court mandate mandated counseling um and stuff like that so it can be really stressful um and it can involve multiple systems and systems are often complicit in enabling litigation abuse judges rarely call it out for what it is and as abusive um and it can be very difficult um to get judges to see that hey this is what's going on they also might start cases in other um jurisdictions in other places um in order to keep the litigation going um they may file claims they might they might um dis um discharge claims um and and try any way they can to um engage in litigation abuse next slide so how are we hoping to address criminalization through our project criminalization and survivorship so like I said criminalization and survivorship is born out of the criminalization of women project which I failed to give you a little bit more information about our criminalization of women project at the clinic provides services to women who have been char and gender diverse people who have been charged in relation to the gender- based violence they've experienced and what we do is we give them some summary legal advice and we help them navigate the criminal law system um so we're trying to take the best practices from that program and and um we've created um and are undergoing the review of a best practices manual to be able to um provide it to other organizations because what we do with that program is we have one lawyer who manages the program um and she g she gives the initial summary legal advice and she kind of manages the cases is but we also have a list of proono lawyers who are experts in criminal law who practice criminal law in day in and day out as defense lawyers who will meet with the survivors um to give them more detailed summary legal advice and sometimes even help with crown pre-trials now crown pre-trials are a way for um anybody with a criminal charge to negotiate the resolution of that charge and um often what we see in the criminalization of women project is the resolution that the crown is trying to seek is a peace bond and pars partner assault response program and um attending the partner the partner assault response program isn't really applicable for the survivor because the whole pro the whole program is designed for the abuser and um I think as well you have to kind of admit the harm that you've done um which can be very difficult for a survivor when when they're actually the ones um that are the targets of the the the assault and the abuse and are not the ones perpetrating it um so that that 12 to 15 week program is not really a good outcome for them in in in doing and can be harmful to them to go through um and then peace bonds are usually in place for one year and it's to keep the peace and be of good behavior and generally not to contact the expouse um now these peace bonds they can show up on vulnerable sector checks so it's can be difficult for survivors at that time to um proceed with their jobs um especially if they work in the v vulnerable sector um sometimes even affects their education paths and their ability to seek education um because whether colleges will will let them especially if it's like a practicum placement with vulnerable sector uh so it's very difficult ult sometimes to actually go through the peace bond process and many defense lawyers crown duty council think that pars in a peace bond is a great resolution to criminal charges of assault because it leads to no criminal conviction in the end once the peace bond is over there's no more record of the peace bond and of the charges however as I just stated there is impacts in in going through pars and a peace bond um and it's not applicable for survivors so at Crown pre-trials what our what our proonal lawyers try to do is to negotiate with them to get with the crown to get maybe counseling instead for the survivors at places like our clinic um and not to have to have a peace bond um so that they can continue on with their lives once the counseling is over and have the charges dropped regardless um or concluded regardless so um so that's the um general um promising practices that we have at the clinic with our criminalization of women pro program and the goal of the criminalization survivorship is to be able to provide this best practice manual to other organizations so that they can do the same thing in their organizations um we also will be developing um policy papers that um will discuss um such things as as what policies can be changed to impact and lessen the amount of survivors being charged with criminalization um we're also looking to do one on self the use of self-defense um and how that has changed over time um and whe how course of control can be brought into that um we're also having bilingual forums in each city or forums in each city and a bilingual one in Montreal um so we just had our one in Edmonton um yesterday so that was exciting we did it via Zoom um and the goal of the forums in the in the different regions is to learn the regional realities of each region and and how survivors are being criminalized in that region and and what resources are available for them and what more can be done in those communities to address the criminalization of survivors we're also doing regional court observations in all four cities as well so again just to repeat to remind you it's Edmonton Halifax Montreal and the greater Toronto area so we've um have both employed students and volunteers that are going into the courts every day and are observing bail court guilty plea court um domestic violence specific courts um to see what's happening in the courts um and how does this differ maybe based on gender based on race um and the findings of that regional court observations will help um and and will help form the policy paper development and what they're also looking at is how do how is domestic violence or intimate partner violence dealt with in the court system in these different regions while we all are under the criminal code of Canada and um criminal the criminal law is federal in in Canada there's very much regional differences in how cases are dealt with based on location based on the size of the community this the the amount of um of criminal activity and and what kind of cases they get um and so our students are also looking at what are the regional differences in how courts operate and deal with domestic violence cases um regardless like as a whole not just as a um a uh in individual cases so we're also doing consultation with stakeholders um we have done a um or sorry we're going to be establishing a national community engagement working group for um service providers which we'll hopefully get from service providers who deal with criminalized survivors to be able to come and speak to us and inform parts of the project uh we'll also will have multilingual fact sheets that we will be um publishing that will be um available for survivors to discuss um so to give them knowledge about things like bail hearings um PARS in a peace bond what like what PARs is and what peace bonds are um and what the kind of what the the path of of the criminal process looks like so they can get kind of a bird's eye view of what's ahead um these are the kind of fact sheets we're doing we're also uh doing a a mini guide on the criminal system for survivors um and as well we have a national community engagement working group of survivors that um have been engaged in the criminalization of women project um that are informing our outcomes of our multifact multilingual fact sheets and seeing you know if there's any missing information if there's anything unclear if there's anything we need to include um they're reviewing those reviewing those fact sheets as well and those both those both those national community engagement working groups is run by Rosa rosa does great work with the with the um survivors and service providers and um she's the one heading up those parts of the the project um what's missing on here is actually our um pilot program for criminal court support so we hired back in January we hired four parallegal students to do criminal court support for the um survivors who are navigating criminal court and so what they do is they go to court with them um and they see um they provide emotional support they might provide support at other types of meetings whether it be with um social assistance meetings or whether it be with um meetings with other outside lawyers like family lawyers or something like this um and kind of help them navigate the whole process and with a specific focus on the criminal law process but um can it can reach a little bit farther than that um and as well we're doing knowledge sharing and training just as we are today in sharing knowledge of what we know about criminalization of women women and and gender diverse people and survivors and um how we're seeing it on the ground in in um in Toronto specifically um and hopefully you know all of this work that we're doing will inform the policy papers we're developing and will inform how we advocate on this issue moving forward in Canada um and will give us some substance to put forward when we're arguing for things like course of control not to be criminalized or for mandatory charging to be changed um that we have information to back up why these things shouldn't should be changed um so that's a the goal of the project um aside from also just raising awareness of the issue of criminalizing survivors um so yeah and um I think I'll take this last little bit to tell you um a little bit about what we have seen through the project so far um and how the criminalization of survivors is really difficult um it can be often um perpetuated by by gender bias um for example you know police just not believing survivors um for police believing stereotypes about survivors like maybe um you know the stereotype like racial stereotypes such as the you know the angry black woman and stuff like that um we also have seen that what what's really interesting is we've seen that with assault with a weapon women are being charged with assault with a weapon and it being the weapon is something like an iced coffee or the child's teddy bear um while men are being charged with things that are actually a weapon such as um knives and um guns and so that's really interesting that um we're seeing this gender bias in in these cases and and women being charged with assault with a weapon when it's not really something that could do real harm to somebody um yes a lot of things can be weapons that do harm but a child's stuffy and an iced coffee are not something that could cause harm um and we're seeing how um more and more how courts of control and litigation abuse play into this um and how survivors are having to navigate criminal processes while trying to heal and and maybe also trying to deal with family law issues or immigration law issues and it being um very difficult to navigate both at the same time so um I think this concludes this part of the webinar i think we talked a little fast but um we're we're more than happy to answer all of your questions and um yeah talk have a little bit more discussion about criminalization of survivors wonderful thank you both so much i don't think you talked fast it was great and you shared so much excellent information great emma can you quickly put up the final slide so before we move into the Q&A and at this point if you have questions please do put them in the Q&A box you should see that on the bottom of your screen but do take a moment and Jason will also share it in the chat for you to give us feedback about this and also link to the website to check out future webinar Wednesdays so while we're waiting for the questions to come in I wanted to thank you again for such important information and I've always followed your clinic's work but I had no idea just how much you were doing in terms of advocacy and knowledge mobilization and just it's incredibly impressive and such a wonderful resource for all of us to know about i was um wondering just a bit it's slightly off the topic of this but I wanted to know Rose if you could share a little bit more about your work on the migration project because that sounds so fascinating okay um sure so that was a national project um that we had it in BC Quebec and Manitoba Ontario so four provinces involved and um the main um organization was in BC and Baba Schlifer was partnered with it and then we worked on policy position paper draft policy position paper to uh for recommendation for policy change basically um we had uh sex and migration workers and then we had another policy position paper for gender- based violence survivors how the survivors are affected and that was one of the papers we did and um so those are the recommendations at the end of the project we met with the MP and Then we presented what we had the recommendations and we were hoping like it would go somewhere to then the policy change like they will um have an idea or of rough idea of what migrant women's needs are so that is what the project was about it was um two-year project at which is ended and uh we had the draft policy precision paper so right after that then we had the clinic started this project criminalization and survivorship project so um I took the project coordinator position for that and we are working on that now yeah and Sarah if I might add I just realized that we didn't really give an intro to our clinic and what ou
" clinic does so please go ahead if you give me a few moments I I'll do that so um our clinic is based in Toronto um and we serve women and gender diverse people who've experienced violence and we do that in multiple ways we uh have a legal team that helps in family law cases in immigration law cases and with sexual assault advising survivors of their options after a sexual assault um we also have um special projects such as this one um that do um specialized services um so we have the criminalization of women project that helps women and gender diverse people who are criminalized we also have the hashtag andmeto project which helps um women and gender diverse people who have been um sexually harassed at work or assaulted at work um navigate that and and pursue um legal complaints um and and internal employer complaints uh we also have as well a self-represented litigance project which helps self self-represented litigants um navigate whatever legal system they're they're navigating um we have counseling at the clinic so our services are we aim for them to be wraparound and consider the whole person and not just the legal matters that they're involved in so we have counseling services where we run groups um as well so we have do individual counseling we do group counseling and then we also have interpretation services um our interpretation services are really cool because what we do with them is we train interpreters um um women and gender diverse people to become interpreters and then we hire them to do interpretation for us at the clinic and they also can take on jobs like they're they're an independent contractor they can take on jobs um elsewhere as well um so um in interpretation as well which is really needed because most of our clients come from um racially and ethnically diverse communities um and require language translation um so we have um or interpretation so we have interpretation services um and yeah we also have some child care while while um people have appointments um and we really try to to provide like I said wraparound services for the survivor we also have high needs case management which is what Rosa does um Rosa I'll let you speak a little bit about your role as a high needs case manager um so um high need case manager basically um the client who has a complex needs they have um criminal code happening and then they do have um mental health issues they needed uh support navigating the system so um the clients who have a multiple and complex needs and they that those are the clients that I provide support so I'm doing part-time uh as a national project coordinator for criminalization and survivorship project other part-time I'm doing as high needs case manager and um also clinic has um transitional and housing support program so the clients who uh come to the clinic who have been abused by the partner and we help them get subsidized housing priority housing and of course housing is like has it own policy like you have to be living with the abuser or left the abuser within 3 months you need to apply but in those criteria categories if women um qualifies then we help them get the housing too so it's a it the clinic has all support system legal counseling housing um case management and all the calls goes through intake so then intake decided who they allocated the client for services yeah and we also as well um operate as a clinic um with core values such as anti-racism anti-opression and providing trauma-informed services to survivors um so that kind of forms the basis of our work as a clinic with each other and with um with the survivors that we we serve that's absolutely fantastic and I love like the wraparound holistic approach especially and as you're describing it it sounds to me a lot like you've really preempted a lot of things that would be barriers to safety for these survivors so that's that's fantastic we did have a question come in and I'll it's a little bit two-part so I'll break it down as we go but the first part of the question is does this program only focus on gender minorities and women or does it support men who are victims of domestic violence as well um yes so our clinic only focuses on women and gender diverse people so that is the um focus of the program as well and the second part of the question is how can we refer clients to you that may benefit from this support yeah so part of our criminalization of women project um that can help people in Ontario um so um you can find the information on our website schipercl clinic.com um of the criminalization of women project um and contact our intake team if you have a client that you think should be um yeah that you think should be helped that's great thank you and they also in their question said """"Loved the presentation thank you so much."""" Awesome oh perfect and Rosa did put some information in the chat as well that would help thank you Rosa and now there's we have a bit more time for questions if anyone wants to put them in the Q&A function and I'll I have one more as we're waiting to see if others have questions although I know that your presentation provided so much information and clarity already so for both of you personally what what do you love most about this work because it's work that has so much passion driving it rosa I'll let you go first um to me I started working at the clinic as a housing worker so when I started working as a housing worker when a women come to the clinic and uh um like want to relieve the abuser but there's no financial means so supporting getting them welfare which is Ontario works we call it and that get housing and the happiness the peace and the freedom the women feel that motivation that feeling of that freedom that a women got that is what um the happiness I it started for me and then from that on different position I held at the clinic and um this particular project criminalization and survivorship and I run the community engagement working group then we do have 10 participants in the group who went through the criminalization not only we provide information and then they we learn so much from them too because they have firsthand experience going through the criminal justice system and how they get affected by it and um and the reality of what exactly happened but how the system and the perpetrator changed the narrative and where they ended up the knowledge that we are receiving from them and that is tremendous and uh so one of the participant after the last community engagement working group that she emailed when she came to the clinic she said use this to whatever purpose you needed whether it is for a project or for um funding purpose anything use this because she wrote it from her heart saying she came to the clinic because the perpetrator um abused her without um she speaks FYI she said I didn't know um how to communicate well in English language and the clinic held me in their hand and supported me through everything i got housing I got um court support I got Ontario like the whole all support and she said I'm a free women now like that letter made us feel like it's a we achieved so much kind of a feeling it may not be the whole people but one person at a time right like it's it's every women is in an abuse-free life that is the courage and happiness and the motivation and enthusiasm like everything we get it from the women we are supporting and serving so well said yeah I don't know how I follow up Rose on that one that was a beautiful answer um but I think um what I really love about my role is bringing awareness to the issue um and I think it's something that is not is really overlooked among lawyers among crown attorneys the police um general society um that and and service providers that um this can happen to survivors i think it's often shocking to people that this can happen to survivors but we see it on a daily basis here at the clinic and um yeah I get a lot of happiness sharing the information and knowing that you know with one more person knowing about the issue you know that um that will help the women we serve as well and the gender diverse people we serve as well so um yeah that's what I've really loved most about my job how you both explain that is just so powerful and it stands out to me i think it's an important message for all of us is we can't single-handedly fix the whole problem but survivor by survivor we can make a big difference absolutely another question came in from Claire claire was wondering """"What type of coordination or collaboration are you looking for in regards to receiving more referrals from other healthcare teams clinics or hospitals?"""" Rosa do you want to answer or um so we basically provide um services to um for people who are in Ontario so clients who live in Ontario like we don't have catchment area in terms of in Ontario so um we provided service for them so that is for client service for project this is a n national project so we are doing national project we are doing forums we are doing webinars and like we um code observations like we hire students to do the court observation and then learn from them the the what they observed in criminal court like it's um any litigation abuse like whatever they are observing um that we based on that we have to we are thinking of writing the policy paper too so that is what we are doing right now but in terms of client work it's the clients from Ontario we are serving great thank you and just for you wanted to share oh sorry sir oh sorry no please go ahead i didn't mean to cut you off Rosa no sorry kelly you wanted to add Oh yeah i was all I was going to say is that um you know for places in Ontario I think connecting with our intake team would be best um as well as um you know thank you for being here today because it's really great um I assume Claire that you're from a healthcare team of some sort um to to learn these things because um you likely come across these survivors as well in the work that you do and just knowing more about the topic can mean that there's more referrals to our program if needed and um that more women get and gender diverse people get helped so that's fantastic so we have one more more of a comment than a question coming in and I think it's a fantastic way to wrap up unless anyone wants to pop more questions in the chat but an anonymous attendee says """"Thank you for sharing this insightful and very much needed project with us your dedication goes a long way you mentioned that you had working groups of survivors helping you develop a lot of the post project materials so I guess there's a little bit of a question i was wondering if you could explain a little bit more about what this process looks like and thank you yeah so we have students that are researching the topics and and kind of create the first draft of the multilingual fact sheet um and then from there um I review it as the lawyer on the project to make sure it's legally accurate and then we get another lawyer at the clinic to also review it to make sure it's legally accurate as well um and then we present it to the community engagement working group which meets two to three times a year um so we first present on the topic about whatever topic it is for them to gain an understanding and then have them look at the p the fact sheet itself which is one to two pages and um give us any feedback of whether there's like missing information or or other things that I mentioned before and then from there we'll go get it translated into different languages through our interpretation team so yeah I it's it's all so wonderful and thoughtful how you integrate survivors into your work it's very important absolutely i think survivors voices are the thing that should always be at the forefront of this work agreed thank you both for doing that and to your clinic i think that wraps up the questions so I'm sure everyone in the virtual audience is joining me and thanking you both so much for taking the time today and for providing such important and thoughtful information about your work so thank you so much thank you thank you and to those Thank you and to those in attendance please make sure to take the survey as well it's in the chat for you""",,,,,,,,,,

0FrkNNkYI00,Promise for HopeEquity in Community Intiatives Towards Gender Equality  Manisha Gupte  TEDxILSLaw,2025-03-27T15:46:03Z,UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q,gender violence,IN,1,34,0,,"for having me here for this uh TEDex conversation and I'm going to utilize the next uh 18 20 minutes that I have uh to speak about uh what we call the promise of hope uh because so much that we see around us is so hopeless and we feel that we cannot change anything but here is is a story from rural Maharashtra where change has been shown through certain pathways so if we can have the next slide so this is what I'm going to talk about today a promise for hope equity as we know is social justice samajik nai and equity is the best route possible towards gaining equality which we know is a legal standard that requires us to prove that there is equality of access there's equality of opportunity and most importantly there's equality of result yeah and equity that is social justice is required until the fact that we can prove equality of result not just access or opportunity so I am a rural community worker actually uh and uh my work over the past five decades the first decade has been in Mumbai and the last 40 years have been in rural Maharashtra so I'm just going to talk of pathways towards social change that bring to us the possibility of hope the first thing that we learned was do not assume anything learn from people uh we were part of non-party political groups and everybody from Gandhi to JP to everybody said go to the villages uh educated people need to keep quiet a little bit so zip it up keep your ears open keep your eyes open learn from people do not lead people because people are smarter than you the fact that they are alive means that they are smarter than you in those situations most of us wouldn't have survived so go learn and learn with humility walk along with people and if possible and when it's possible let people lead you and that's what we went so I just want to use examples of uh you know every point that I make so when we started our savings and credits program and uh we started with the poorest we started with the smallest amount so we didn't want the rich we didn't want the men to get involved we didn't want them get interested and along with that we built women's collectives uh to speak about violence to speak about political rights to speak about safety inside the house and outside the house so we were doing this while we were doing this loans and credits and we had loans and credits for health largely When we reached a particular point came everybody can you sell this for us can you sell that for us yeah so suddenly when women had the buying power it was to use it on stuff they did not need in the first place and then came the life insurance people would you like to insure the women that you're working with we had 6,000 members at that time and we said we'll talk to the women and then they thought we were bluffing we talked to the women what was the women's response they laughed they said ""Are you crazy now do you want to give the husband one more incentive to kill us i can hear this collective grasp gasp right in the audience this is what people will tell you do not assume anything when in doubt ask when in doubt democratize learn from people now single people single individuals do not have the power to challenge structures structures of patriarchy of gender of cast of class of say heteronormativity of disability all these structures no single person can change but the moment you have collectives you see magic happening and I'm going to talk about this magic and we know magic is only a slate of hand right magic is not magic yeah but it happens so seamlessly when collectives get formed that it almost seems magical and I have been honored to see this magic throughout these 40 50 years now awareness of personal actions is extremely necessary because otherwise these structures are very very smart they've survived 5,000 7,000 years it cannot happen unless they're extremely smart right so they will have new faces and if you're not very careful our activism can lead to the violation of rights of another vulnerable group or another marginalized group and therefore we have to be extremely careful when we use strategies also we have to see that our methods are different our methods have love compassion empathy nonviolence the only answer to darkness is light and the only answer to hate is love isn't it and those are the methods that we have to use so we cannot use humiliation as a method we cannot get a man to be humiliated in public because he's beaten his wife because he's raped somebody as a feminist I don't have to tell you how angry I would be at a situation like that you still cannot do that you cannot have the police enter without a warrant because if you allow that then in whose home are the police going to enter tomorrow not the police party not the serpent's home they are going to go into the hand into the nomadic tribes the poorest the Daliths the Balutars because those are the homes that they can enter we cannot allow anybody to be tortured in police custody because that's not the method to go ahead so always be reflexive and aware of what we do start early and that's not that's not Einsteinian physics right start early because that's where you know the young minds are being prepared so if we want equality we have to start very early and our work has to have transformation not just reformation so for example if we have counseling centers for domestic violence as an example if we want our centers to run forever then really we have to go into the community and do what increase violence right because if we don't increase violence who's going to come to our centers on the other hand what I believe when you come into social activism our job is to lose our job yeah when Gandhi went to open the first asylum for people with leprosy in Varda he said I would be much happier the day I have to come and lock up this asylum because then I know that leprosy patients are not being thrown thrown out of their homes yeah and so our job is really to challenge structures and so therefore spend more time on property rights and challenging all the controls of patriarchy that is control over production of reproduction that is social reproduction biological reproduction sexuality mobility not having inheritance in your mother's home which forces you to get married and not having any property rights so our work has to have transformation now whom do you work with you have to work with the affected so if you're talking of child marriage we're talking of early marriage child marriage is a legal entity early means even at 50 if I don't want to get married and somebody's asking me to get married it's an early marriage right so if you want to get married then when you want to get married with whom you want to get married how you want to get married and for how long you want to stay married these are all the rights of marriage right safe entry safe exit and stay safe cohabitation inside so we start with adolescent girls and of course these are the boys who are going to be the future bridegrooms their sisters are getting married their brothers are getting married so you work with the whole community i mean child marriage we have to remember that a single individual cannot affect that you have to work with the families and just working with families won't work because the early bird catches the worm and there are only that many eligible boys and that many eligible girls within the endogamus group in which arranged marriages take place so you have to work with the entire community to see that nobody goes to fish earlier than somebody else and then what is the transformative as aspect of this you don't have to get married in gamasi right there's no der of eligible boys or girls i mean I want to marry a boy i want to marry a girl i don't want to get married there's no d and so that is transformative to look beyond your cast to look beyond your religion to look beyond nationality beyond everything so that becomes the transformative aspect using street theater to mobilize because that is something that people understand folk theater yeah using cultural forms and then we use also forum theater where we actually have a theater of the oppressed where you put forward a situation and then immersively get people to involve themselves and to change the narrative of the theater what would have happened if this had not happened what would not have happened if this had happened and so therefore then get people to do it in a very safe way sometimes putting up theater or puppetry also helps us to see our own problems from a distance so rather than say this is wrong in your life Manisha if I see it on the stage I say oh this is my life yeah and it helps me much easier it's easier for me to talk of the opportunities and possibilities in my life when I look at someone else acting it for me on stage working with young married couples before violence starts because the moment violence starts we know violence is about power and control right only those who have power can perpetrate violence on those whom they have control and the people who are in control whether from police custody to a family to castbased violence anything at all it's the people who cannot talk back people who cannot question and if people question whose word will not be respected in the places that they go to so we know that that happens so start working with young married couples right from the beginning so what do we do throughout the day get the married couples give them beautiful clothes to wear give her a shalvaram give him a sherwani yeah they look pretty they look nice you know give flowers to each other encourage a lot of nonsexual touch encourage a lot of intimacy make them a team so it's not like you know you think you're smarter than me give them jigsaw puzzles the couple is a team so everybody is fitting the missing pieces and the team works he sees a kicker football and my goodness you know feels so smart yeah so this is what we do get their marriage registered to prevent bigamy tell them about laws related to violence talk about contraception just have lot of fun and I just want to give you two quotes there's one girl who said ""I was so tense when I got married last year because outside both the families were having a quarrel and I was really scared that the wedding was going to be called off."" And the bridegroom her bridegroom of one year said ""You know what i was also very tense."" and he touched her and something happened between them the fact that he was also tense on that day made a difference in their relationship another young bridegroom said ""Two years ago I had an arranged marriage today I had a love marriage."" Yeah and when you love somebody when you are friends with somebody you do not hurt them men and women are allowed every relationship except friendship you can have a brother you can have a father you can have a son but once we become friends and I'm not just talking of men and women i'm talking of interex people i'm talking of trans people i'm talking of all human beings if we have love and friendship among us we will go out of our way to keep everybody safe so these were the responses some of the responses that we saw women's collectives raising demands at the village level so this one daughter-in-law complained about her domestic violence to the village head and he said this happens h grin and bear it she went up on the stage and she said okay it's happened to me but there are so many daughters-in-law here and it's happening to all of them so it's not a personal issue you came to my wedding you ate at my wedding my parents sent me to this village on your trust and that was a public event and now you're telling me that domestic violence is a private event so that's the first point she made the second point she made was that if all the daughters-in-law in this village walk out at this moment what are you going to do so she made the issue a collective issue and very brilliantly she connected daughters-in-law and mothers-in-law together because every mother-in-law is a daughter-in-law of the village and she brought solidarity between women so trust people's agency trust people's intelligence trust people sometimes I get scared and I say you know what are you going to do and they say you cannot put a limit on my empowerment i will I got beaten earlier i'll get beaten tonight but I'll sleep knowing I got them really mad and I think that is the empowerment then you have to deal with stakeholders right your police partails police I don't want to take the issue of domestic violence because you'll retract it tomorrow and sure many times she will retract because it's because of that kungu manga sutra that she goes to all the hikums the saw aashna bojans right that is the situation you can leave a job but marriage is a oneway entry for women there's no exit out of that very easily more than one woman can walk into that marriage with the same husband but the women who go in cannot very easily walk out especially if they have children that's what you know there's a proverb that we say that once you have the calf you don't have to tie the cow to the cow just loiters around the calf so once you have children it's very very difficult to walk out of a marriage so talk to them and explain why when women have to retract they retract so training of police officers etc now your human rights may seem very distant from someone else's human rights and today we are living in a global world of us and them we and them right and so therefore human rights means fighting for the rights of who you think are most removed from you about 30 to 35 of our rural activists come to the pride march every year in Pune and it's very funny because a boy said you know Tai the first time I said I am gay that's okay I was looking around is anyone watching me but once I said it five six times it didn't seem so weird yeah it just seemed so natural and now our activists are bringing their children to the march and the children are singing it in the you know in their bathrooms I am gay that's okay you know whatever you know I am trans that's okay so when this becomes normalized language and then to go we know you know in Indian culture we call it adw right that me and the universe are the same there is no difference so the moment you realize actually you know what I never questioned my own sexuality ever in my entire life my neighbor's child is trans there's this interex child you know there's in in my community my eyes open up and I realize there's nothing like we and them we are all part of the same continuum and that's why the human rights of those who we think are far away from us are actually not so far away now we don't want a protectionist approach I bring my husband out on the street to protect me from your husband you bring your husband out on the street to be protected from my husband how how about us both leaving a husband's home and coming out on the street on our own possibility right but we like the men in our lives we like our fathers sometimes they are abusers too we like our partners well they are partners we like our sons we raised them whom do we complain about our sons so what we want is not protection for us we want protection of our rights and though we know that most rapes and most killings and most violence happens inside the house by people we know and people we trust yet we talked of public safety because at this point at least we are talking of stranger danger even if you're not ready to talk of family violence so what did we do we did safety mapping and then we got state obligation to respect protect fulfill promote our rights right and then we did this mapping so you see 1 2 3 red dots the severity of violence that girls face this was gendered for example this is the parking lot the boys called this dangerous because of gang wars the girls called it dangerous just because there was a bunch of boys there it was time specific during the day something was safe at night it wasn't too few people unsafe too many people unsafe and you see if the bus stand just go back please the bus stand there has three dots the maximum dots now if that's going to be unsafe how are girls going to go to another town from their village for education and if anyone sexually harasses me or even my friend all our education gets stopped and once we know education stops marriage is the penia for all issues and we have to tell women it doesn't solve the problem it only brings you a grandchild on your lap the next year so this is what we did this is all done by adolescent girls next one during the daytime it was different and then at night there was the same map became completely different next please now we have to ask ourself hard questions you're not going to be popular if you're popular all the time you're doing something wrong you're just tinkering with the system right you cannot be popular if you're changing structures but we are not here to get anybody's votes no but we have to be transparent we have to be honest we have to be respectful even to those we disagree with we have to believe in change otherwise just get everybody get all the men in a row and shoot them is that going to be the answer they all come from the same place they all come from here they are raised differently men are raised differently to appropriate and misappropriate and women are raised differently to give up right the Simon the Buoy says that women are not born they're made yeah and that is how we make men violent and we make women submissive so we have to believe in social change incorporate reflexivity constantly ask yourself questions did I challenge a structure today a girl came up to me and said ""I'm in a consensual relationship with somebody for the past 3 years he's refusing to marry me shall I charge him with rape?"" No you cannot you cannot right because it's not rape i lost my virginity friend what did you lose you gained an experience it might lead to pain it might lead to joy a mixture of both you don't know in the morning what is what and evening what is what right we're roller coasters i mean relationships and love are roller coasters but ask yourself a question if he does not want to marry me why do I want to marry him in the first place yeah why do we say get a girl married to a rapist why when a relation starts with rape so it is not about populism and the reflexivity is not to replace patriarchy with matriarchy but with equality that is the kind of reflexivity and learn and unlearn from lived realities of the excluded because as I started off it's their situations that they know best they know the answers sometimes we are the reason why they have the problems right we cannot be there to go and release them of those problems because we might be the problem and if we take decisions on their behalf we're actually part of the problem and not part of the solution so people have the agency trust people learn learning is difficult unlearning is even more difficult we have to unlearn a lot of things that have been taught by our families by our communities by our cultures our religions law media everything and we have to unlearn that and the leadership has to come from the most marginalized and the most excluded and this cycle again goes back to my first slide which says do not assume anything because once you reach that level once you climb a mountain the horizon becomes bigger and you climb another mountain and the horizon becomes bigger right so as as our horizon becomes bigger newer questions touch our minds and those questions will lead us to answers thank you very much"

the opposition  Em bai line upla na bai koapim ass blo upla lo line   Nao u pairap Lon taim u stap wei   Why are all rhe smart people in the OPPOSITION  And the award for greatest pretender goes to  ,the member for wab The Honorable Dr loo has just stated he absolutely correct I completely endorse those statements and his sentiments I want to commend governor pacov and his Deputy Governor bird for being very passionate about the subject matter a subject matter that all of us all of us should be concerned about I just have a few comments to make and it's basically in line with what the good member ofab has stated about enforcement of laws but before I commence I want to just elaborate on some of the efforts that we are undertaking in our Province most recently we evicted a particular settlement known as B compound in the heart of Poa the capital of Oro Province this particular settlement was illegally occupied for more than 30 years and it had become a hot bed of crime a home for criminals committing very violent crimes against citizens in my Province and the most of the victims were women and finally we got sick and tired of listening to you know these concerns raised not sick and tired of listening to the concerns I rephrase myself we got sick and tired of the these activities that were being perpetrated and we decided to take a stance whereby we would identify all illegal settlements in our Province especially those that are harboring criminals and start removing the people who are living there harboring these criminals committing these crimes and we started with B compound as a result Law and Order improved significantly in pada and our women folk were very grateful and they said so they commented on social media or wherever I happened to be and they bumped into me they told me crime had dropped significantly this didn't obviously solve the problem most of these people were from our Province what we did was to send them back to the districts and then working with my open members I'm urging them to open these districts up these districts that have deteriorated and become dilapidated over the years and that led to Urban drift significant Urban drift that we cannot control but we must I want to urge my colleagues especially open members let's open this District so that our people can return to them and then what needs to happen is we have to build police stations or those existing police stations that are there we have to refurbish them build police houses buy vehicles Ure that policemen are there to provide the security needed so that these economies can become thriving economies provide opportunities for people give jobs for our youth and stop this Urban drift that is contributing to many of these problems that we are speaking about B compound will be the home now to a temporary Provincial Police Headquarters that we are building there and a significant office will be built there that will be dealing specifically with gender-based violence and we would like to recruit policemen and women who will be specifically tasked to deal with no other crime but gender-based violent crimes I want to encourage my colleagues to do the same I say this because I agree with Dr Leno we come and say all these things we make these statements but what are we actually doing I want to State what I'm doing and encourage others to follow suit in regards to the enforcement of the laws we have to put some serious penalties and enforce his penalties enforce his penalties crimes such as rape should be life imprisonment life imprisonment no Paro no bail even as I speak there are rapist who have been given bail and who are sent back to their the community awaiting trial why can the ministers responsible look at this and what about the photos the videos that we see on social media where our women have been tortured in the most brutal ways possible unimaginable ways and it's not only those who are perpetrating those crimes but those who are supporting the perpetration of those Crimes by taking these videos and photos and being there nothing has happened to these people so I agree with Dr Leno in these regards let's en these laws and then let's enforce these laws Minister for police we really need to pay serious attention to the policing of these laws this morning I raised this in government caucus about small crimes or offenses that have been committed that have been ignored for instance roadblocks I made mention of this now you can drive around anywhere in Pap nikini and you will see a roadblock anytime there's an incident someone's cat dog died there'll be a roadblock the community will set up a roadblock and they will start collecting money from motorists and they will harass motorists nothing will happen to them this is a crime police have to arrest these criminals that are perpetrating this crime and I'm just using this roadblock as an example but there are many other similar crimes small crimes that have been committed littering loitering urinating in public public Gatherings that are unsanctioned that are Rowdy and it makes all of these little crimes for us and when I say us I mean most of us here with exception to our three female members of parliament for us as men we don't think about these issues we just drive through a roadblock we just there's a crowd there we don't mind we find our way through it but for women to go through this it's an ordeal and they go through this every day after this session go and ask your partners your wives your sisters your aunties your mothers about the harassment that they receive as motorists when they're driving around for instance or when they're just walking from here to the bank for instance or W they're just going to school or coming back for instance I bet you if we were to ask these young girls that are sitting up there they will tell you that they harassed like this on almost a daily basis what are we doing about it I totally agree with Dr loo here we have to enforce these laws so I would like to add to those recommendations that have been brought here by the presenters who have made very good suggestions before me one let's enact serious laws two let's have dedicated police resources to enforcing these laws every Province every District I mean Dr L should not need to come here and talk about something that's happening in wbec where a person is harassing his citizens why isn't the PPC there dealing with that why isn't the police station commander in his district dealing with that what's going wrong so that he has had to bring it here to Parliament to raise it to the minister of police something is wrong and I think we really need to scrutinize what we're doing in so far as law enforcement is concerned or policing is concerned we can talk all we want about investment and how great we are and how wonderful we are as a nation Rich etc etc we are not going to get anywhere unless we get Law and Order right so I Gentlemen please this is not a matter of something we should be laughing at member for CH and uh governor for isic this is not something to be laughing at it's not funny governor for is you're a deputy chairman you should not be laughing about this it's not something to be funny or laughing about Gentlemen let's be serious remember for not fly this is not something to laugh at let's be serious let's be serious thank you let's be serious policing is a real problem here let's overhaul our police let's bring back the pride command and control the discipline the ethics the morals that we used to be proud of when we thought of the royal papan Nini constabulary let's bring that back they need help they need resources they need serious attention and then by putting those resources where it matters then we can improve the lot of our women folk finally what I would just like to add is the 2027 elections are not far off and what have we done in so far as implementing the recommendations that were tabled here in the report presented by our good governor for EB for the elections what we would truly benefit from would be to have more women in our part parament and to have more women in our Parliament we need to encourage more women to stand for elections and we can do that if we make it a safe or conducive environment for our women folk to stand for elections thank you Mr Deputy speaker
b8tJyrudH2s,Gender Based Domestic Violence II Rev Mrs Talatu Bako,2025-03-27T06:00:26Z,UC_43aGdcd0mLYjeK84Yn3mg,gender violence,IN,2,20,1,God hates violence like He hates divorce You dont conflict violence on another human being Love your neighbor as yourself,next we have uh past Tatu Bak Shalom everyone um I'm looking we're looking at domestic violence and the Bible does the Bible have anything to say about domestic violence um is it really necessary so in looking at this let's just look at what domestic violence is domestic violence is a pattern of abusive Behavior so it's abusive behavior in any relationship that is used by one partner to gain or maintain power and control so it is about power and control over the other e in a romantic relationship or an intimate relationship it is also known as intimate partner violence of course you can also have family domestic violence so um that is what domestic violence is it is um a pattern of behavior that seeks to have power and control over the other person now domestic violence can involve different uh aspects so you have the physical violence which is hitting um pushing choking or using any kind of physical Force then you have emotional abuse emotional abuse involves verbal and nonverbal attacks so it can be verbal it can be nonverbal and um you have such things as name calling you know some of those name call names uh people call you you can be called stupid uh um Jimmy the kind those kinds of things they put you down so it's put Downs then you have threats or you have manipulation and it this is um this this um affects you emotionally so you have some of these those examples been screaming and shouting at you and sometimes you dare not do anything that the other the partner thinks is wrong and then they shout at you they scream at you they Mock You Calling You hurtful names or using derogatory words about you it could it could um involve suling or refusing to talk or be kind until you do something they want they make you doubt your own sanity then we have um so when we talk about um examples of verbal abuse we know that the Bible warns against abusive speech James talks about about speaking speaking hearing faster than you speak so be quick to listen but slow to speak and the Bible talks about fitly words words that are fitly spoken are like you know an an um an ornament of gold with settins of silver that's an Exquisite ornament and that is what our speech should be like so we have sexual abuse and this is forced sex unwanted toring they touch you and expect you not to not to um react because you shouldn't because it's their right to touch you whenever they want to touch you or however they want to touch you or other forms of sexual coercion of course you know that there's there's there's rape which is of course forse sex then we have Financial abuse and this is controlling access to money withholding financial information or exploiting a partner's resources so they make it difficult for you to have to be to be financially independent to have money you can call your own or to be economically VI uh viable or else what what you have they want to control it must they they give you what even your salary you must give it to them and they can give you what they think they should give you that is financial abuse then we they have psychological abuse some people put emotional abuse and psychological abuse together but I have separated them so you have psychological abuse and this is blackmail they coers you intimidate you using tactics such as manipulation gaslighting stalking or using intimidation to control you you can imagine um um I remember that when I was young I was coming back from school one afternoon and usually I take a short Court um a short route that takes me faster home so I passed by this short route and suddenly I was accosted by a young boy I'm sure he was a teenager but at that time I I was I was about 9 10 and he accosted me and he bullying me for I don't know you from anywhere and he he accusing me of looking at him funny and if you don't if you if you're not careful I will show you sh and it's like I'm me this quiet uh uh introvert girl what where did I see you to have said something to make you um to make you want to accost me or beat me what have I done I just looked at him my heart was beaten though I just looked at him quietly he said all he wanted to say and said go with my tail in between my legs I walked back home but I was wondering what did I do I don't know you from anywhere you see that the next few weeks I never passed that route I would rather take the longer route home I never passed that route again so you see I don't know you from anywhere but he was he was intimidating me so domestic violence has been around for donkey years please let me know when it's it's time so if you follow ancient civilizations you had domestic violence in in ancient cultures from Greece to Rome to Egypt it's always been there wife beaten was considered a husband's right in many European countries so even today here in Africa a lot of a lot of people think that it is the right of a husband to beat his wife because he's disciplining her and a wife thinks that oh he loves me that's why he's beating me so and we we had um in the 18th and 19th Cent ues then the women's rights movements began and all of these things people began to rise up against all of this nonsense and to so today of course we have domestic violence movements gaining momentum in in in here in Africa I'm sure here in in Ghana we have the Police Service where you have the domestic violence unit so you can you can report abuse so what causes domestic violence for many they have grown up that way they've seen violence growing up father bitten mother or mother bitten father and to them it's it's it's the right it's that's the way to live so it it means nothing to them it's just normal they've grown up with it some o others have anger issues that they have grown up with and so it's apart from you see people just get angry and they're aggressive and they want to beat anybody who crosses their path they they've grown up with anger is issues and they have anger management issues so some people have anger management issues they they they are very temperamental they easily get angry and sometimes aggressively angry they need management therapy so for those of you dating or hoping to date and looking at that uh sister or that brother and thinking ah be be just be careful make sure that there's no temper there's no temper management issue there there's no anger issue there because if it is not if it is not handled if it is not um worked on it can lead to a broken home so it's a complex issue really I me it requires a multifaceted approach so what does the Bible say the Bible is God's manual on life and living it contains God's word that is sharp and powerful and that brings transformation it changes our thought patterns our mindsets and behavior for the best so the word of God is the instrument that enables us to live a life of success if we're obedient from Joshua 1 18 and9 so the Bible can explicitly condemns domestic violence the the passage we read earlier on from uh Psalm 115 and and then Malachi 2:16 really talks about treachery about violence some say treachery some say violence in um Malachi 2:16 that you you've you've been treacherous towards your wife or you or or you have been violent towards your wife it is written that God hates divorce but do we also know that God hates violence and abuse if God hates divorce because that is the first thing you are told no you cannot you cannot leave your husband or you cannot leave your wife God hates divorce does God does God like abuse so don't do what will bring divorce if it is a lot of people are going through violence in their relationships violence in their homes and it's not just violence between husband and wife there's violence towards children as well and and we we we take the excuse that we are disciplining children and we unleash violence on them we must be be careful God hates violence as well so in we've looked at Psalm 11 verse5 God talks about how he would he would deal with the wicked who are violent so look at Psalm 11:5 the Bible talks about wickedness and violence and um so what do we do in case of domestic abuse we need to seek protection for ourselves seek protection for yourself in Proverbs 2712 in Proverbs 11:9 all these things talk about you somebody seeing danger the the the the the wise person will protect themselves from that danger coming but the foolish one or the or the simple person just walk straight into it so watch it in your relationships with people the Bible talks about don't be friends with a violent person or you will learn violence from that person so the Bible emphasizes the importance of treating others with love with respect with kindness Believers are to live with humility with gentleness and patience the fruit of the spirit Ephesians 4:2 says with all loneliness and gentleness with longsuffering bearing with one another in love you cannot tell me you love me and you want to hit me you cannot tell me you love me and you want to insult me you cannot tell me you love me and you you want to intimidate me you cannot tell me you love me and you choke my me by the throat and if you're not careful I will kill you that's not love that's violence that's wickedness and nobody should accept that so ultimately the Bible presents a clear message domestic violence is never acceptable and God's heart is to deliver and protect those who are abused in Psalms 5 ver 4-6 for you are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness nor shall evil dwell with you the boastful shall not stand in your sight you shall destroy those who speak falsehood the Lord abur the bloodthirsty and deceitful man so don't be deceitful and use and use violence to deceive the other person make no friendship with an angry man or with an angry person and with a furious man do not go lest you learn his ways and set a snare for your soul so especially if you are going through um domestic abuse domestic violence please see any of the leaders let's talk thank you very much Pastor T

she thinks that she gives you things wat she made you,"health development education law enforcement policies human rights children abuse gender equality race religion politics government sex legal justice democracy because every issue is a woman's issue today we're talking about um gender-based abuse particularly uh domestic violence in Guyana and the world and I have with me Sheena Henry and Martina Haleim two young lovely ladies who have experiences from different backgrounds and me um and we hope to bring to you our different experiences not only that we know about but that um we know about from the news from other women from other girls and um what we really hope is that we encourage you to think about the things we're talking about and to know that the end of the day we're all one female family and that we should look out for each other so that's what we want to talk about so today we're talking about domestic violence and what it is and gender based abuse and so many times people think it's um a cough and a slap yeah but it's so much more than that it's him saying to you you're not good enough or would want to tell you about your private parts and I'm things I'm not even going to mention right now they are hor it's it's really a terrible experience to have and it's one that could scar you if not what treated accordingly or or or get taken seriously as well yeah it's about to get real but uncomfortable real but you know what let's do this i think people think that it's actually very general and not as specific they think that it's only one being physical when there's actually emotional abuse there's psychological abuse as well which is often overlooked and I feel like you know this is one of those platforms where we actually get to really shine the light on it that I'm happy to do well I suffered emotional abuse was from my husband he was my second husband yeah he was very very emotional abused because he know because the law came out there that they became very serious used to take domestic abuse very seriously especially on the physical part so he decided he can be very very mean and very very emotionally abusive he hit me a couple times he slapped me and he hit the children also he would hit the children them too they weren't his children they were my children because you see he had two separate rules he laid down laws and rules how the children and the house should be governed but then when it come to his children there was a different set of laws they could always get the very things that he would speak about against that the church should do his children would get off doing it and if mine does it or even something similar to what it he would come down and give very harsh punishment you know he would hit them you know I remember a case so so we know for sure a cough and a kick and a slap that's domestic violence and that's domestic abuse physical abuse physical abuse anything physical ring your hand ring your ears um slam you into a wall kick you cough you that's domestic abuse right but I remember a case where the judge actually said so this man had killed his wife in one of the islands I think in the Denver River or I see River I can't remember m and the written judgment actually had he told her about the looseness of her parts as men are want to do and this was a written judgment and I was a young law and I was just shocked that this could be something acknowledging in writing but this was the reality so it's not just the kicks and the cuffs it's like you said making you feel useless it's verbal and psychological verbal so Verbal what verbal abuse as in Yeah like like cursing at you using profanity and degrading you making you feel like you have no self worth as well nobody ain't going to want you when I'm done with you you're good for nothing without You're a  you're a um people going to pass you around oh people pass you around right no no man will want you after this yeah it's withholding money so you have to come back to me to get your necessity blackmail emotional blackmail oh if it wasn't for me you wouldn't have that you wouldn't be where you were if it wasn't for me or stopping you from going with your friends cuz if I isolate you and I'm all you have even your family or your family right so isolation keeping you away from people yeah yeah i know of instances where you see I don't know how it I can't explain how it gets so far but it's like people were the woman was actually kept from visiting her family and every time she went to she wants to go visit her family it becomes an issue he would get violent and start to tell her a whole lot of derogatory yeah remarks he would tell me things like he has to mine me he has to take care of me that he's struggling all this burden is his own the children are not his but he has to take care but listen he stopped the father he doesn't want the children to have contact with the father nor with me so how can he support his children and then he could turn around and say insult us you know because he has to take care when he would he was an alcoholic so he would buy his room when he's coming home from school on the way he was a teacher yeah and he would drink and he would work himself up in a frenzy and start anything he would say if he doesn't have to be true because he was just naturally abusive he just wants to be mean that's all but why do you think that is that's because if she's with family and she's with friends she has this extra bit of support that you're trying to take away from her make you completely dependent on him i you know what puzzles me is why would a human being want to do that to another human being for power yeah we'll come to that just for power exactly you know what is to boost their own ego you have got to be such a small person to need to feel the the need to do that to somebody else you know to feel powerful you know what's another form of abuse that people especially women don't talk about so I used to work at Legal Aid and almost everyone who came in for a divorce would tell me bits and pieces of their abusive relationship that they had and by the way when people go for divorce it's after years of it too right putting up putting up with it right and they would always say you know counsel he was rude or he was violent and so but they only if I asked well was he sexually violent also only if I asked they would say yes he used to rape me or he used to make me do things I don't want to do but don't put that in the petition because they don't want to dare and a lot of women actually think that because I'm married to him he can't rape you he can't rape me i'm his sex slave i can do it is his to have and it comes from a long ago thing where women were chatt you were the property of men and because you were they could do whatever they wanted with you whenever however wherever and you didn't have a say and you didn't have a say so people don't count sexual abuse as within the marriage within the marriage or within a relationship as abusive but if he's making you do things tell me no no no let let's just get this square right so you're telling me that so so what we're establishing here is rape occurs within marriages he comes on to you but you're not in the mood and he he he makes advances advances to you even though like you say no out loud and he's coming on but you're married to him so you give in and that is actually Yeah well anything that you don't want to do any kind of no is is rape right and we now recognize since 2010 that in our laws that um that marriage does not is not consent does not flow from marriage you still have to have inherent consent and so a lot of women would tell you that it's not only him having sex with me when I don't want to but him forcing me to do different things that I do not want to do including threesomes and and other you know different things that that people don't want to do but they think they have to keep their marriage but it's just so sad that people would wait until the situation escalates to such a dramatic ending that you know sometimes if you are not lucky you come out with what crippled your hand you suffered some violent injury it so here's the thing so we just examined for you um what types of behavior would amount to domestic violence and and domestic abuse it's physical it's verbal you're a you're good for nothing you're worth nothing it is keeping money away from you it is um isolating you from friends it is sex abuse it is making you feel worthless and and emotionally um weak it is making you dependent on them so there are various things that are um considered domestic violence he used to withhold money even though I work I cannot spend the money i have no control of the money I have to give him because he's saying he has to take care of the home take care of the family and what I'm working for is is not much compared to what he's working for so he should decide how to spend the money and budget the money but we never had stuff because he's always drinking every day every single day he making sure he's coming home with a bottle of rum and he would drink and then he would start abuse quarreling crossing into the we hours in the morning till 2 3:00 in the morning then you can get to sleep i had to turn over all the money all the money that I work where I had to give him and then the next time after I stopped doing domestic work we started the business selling sweet meat i used to um deliver the sweet meat in Georgetown supplying market stalls and whenever I sell I have to bring back all this money and give it to him i have no money to spend on my own i never used to get clothes nothing we never used to get even his children other people had to give them secondhand clothes all the money he would take and he would just drink it out we never used to get anything no oh you make sure there is food yes we get food and that's it just that basic i want to ask you something have you ever suffered domestic abuse well I have been in situations and witnessed it firsthand um based on what you would have said what we would have discussed there unfortunately I'm going to be truthful so that I'm hoping that this will help somebody out there yes yes and I've known family members who would have been unfortunate to be at the bitter experience that as well as well yeah and it's like the stats say it's one in three women one in three so with the three of us here at least one of us will have been abused at some point that's just how how it is you know the thing is some women have you i haven't you haven't i haven't and that's great you're 22 i'm 23 so I hope you live the rest of your life and basically say that but it's also true here is one woman who has never experienced um domestic violence and I think it's interesting to talk about that because sometimes you don't even realize what you're going through is violent cuz you think it's some I was just about to mention that a lot of women don't know that their situations are abusive and they often make excuses for their partner like oh they don't want he doesn't want you to go see your family he doesn't want you to have a social life oh he just loves me so much he's just territorial he's just possessive he just you know wants my company all the time but lo and it's not always him putting his hands on you it is abuse at the end of the day and a lot of women don't realize that their situations are abusive i think it stem too from the environment that you would have been brought up in it's what you see it like becomes and treat as normal right that's why two people don't speak up about it until it's too late sometimes you know it's a good question to ask yourself I think would you want your daughter to feel the way you feel because a lot of us Exactly a lot of us put up with a lot of crap because you love this man it's very complex relationship i like he bad he's better than other people that I know um better the one that I know than the ones I don't i have children with him i have a house we have a mortgage we have investments you know that kind of thing but the question to ask yourself if you're feeling uncomfortable and you're not sure if it's violent would you want your daughter to be going through this and if your answer is no then chances are you need to get out we separated several times but after what after the lies because we took so many counsel and it still wouldn't work out and the lies and the lies one day um his sister came from abroad and he filled her head with lies again and she came she came with a vengeance on me and he separate he filed for a divorce because he always want his way he always asking for things he determined to get his way and when he get his way he finish with it he doesn't want it so this time he filed for the divorce and I was always praying cuz is God help me through this most of all you see if you don't have a connection with God it can be very hard where you lose hope and persons you know commit suicide and those things but because of God he saw me through this he gave me the strength and when he filed for this divorce I took it as an opportunity of God answering my prayers and I came out And after his sister went back he said he didn't want to go through the divorce and role as his normal rigor role and what his game but I said no this is the opportunity god gave me the opportunity i came out because all the children were suffering you stay in this because you see because of the children sick you want to provide for them security but then when you look at how emotionally scarred they are the example is not good so you can't just think about yourself you know you got to look at it all wrong and so that's when I decide that I would um come out of it and I did came out of it i didn't go back so we talked about the types of domestic violence now who does this happen to that's that's the thing it doesn't happen to anybody no one is exempt from abuse it happens to anybody no one is exempt from abuse your race doesn't matter your stature financial position none of those things matter and the age unfortunately as well babies who you know their parents who grew up in that type of household their parents beat them for no specific reason oh I'll give you something to cry for if you don't stop crying and so they pass that on to their children as well and they think it's normal and it's not i'm a mixture of Chinese and Indian yes and a little bit of um African descent yeah from down the generation line so so it's interesting when I worked at again legal aid which was based only in Georgetown we now have legal aid in regions 2 5 6 10 um three and more because it was expanded but when I was there in pre206 legal aid was only in Georgetown and so you had mostly an African gy uh clientele because George is Georgetown mhm and until I worked there because I am from I'm Indian and I've only known the Indian experience um I thought that domestic violence was primarily something that happened to Indian women um and Indian women from a different educational background so because that was my that's what I saw in places where it happened and and you hear there's a saying you know cool man like like be the woman like no so I actually thought so but when the worldwide stat is one in three women around the world so it's black women it's white women it's Chinese women it's Portuguese women it's women amarindian women and the whole thing springs from a desire to be powerful and to show who's man that that's the whole thing who's the boss in this relationship um so it's a power dynamic also now what to do if you are being abused first of all they should definitely report it i think people don't know the extent of what legal assistance is there to to help them many times I reported him to the police at one time when we um he beat my son very badly I reported him he got um locked up for a couple of days and then he got released because I had no one to support me then the father would not he would not support me as well he wasn't regularly supporting me so I had no one really to depend at that time so I couldn't do anything but I I had to um drop the matter yeah so let me tell you Yeah what what did you what would you say people should do before I come in with the actual law well you're going to come in with the law part and the official help and so on that's there but I think support is important and the people around you who love and really care for you would help you if you reach out like I'm talking about your family you know so seek the support from your loved ones you know they they would help see you through it as well because often times as you said we stop so taboo it's like and and the way how society is it's like we are so ashamed to come out and say you know this is what I'm going through or this is what is happening but I would say know who your supporters are who your loved ones are and and seek their help before it is too late my sister and my sister-in-law they were very supportive to me you know they helped me when I made that decision they helped me a lot you know yeah they because I didn't had a home there when I just left they took me in and they supported me until I could get on my feet yeah they supported me so here is the thing and like I said it's a hugely complex issue you love this person this is the person who's supposed to be looking after you but he's pummeling you making you feel like crap making you feel like lesser than yourself but you got these you got children with him you don't know anybody else you already left your family it was very very complex yes I did love him afterwards when I was hurt and I was angry but I did love but I said no I will not go in back into that situation because even though I love him then it can't compensate for all the damages that are being done you know to the children to myself emotionally you know it was very hard but I made up my mind and by God's grace I came out and I start working yeah we have a domestic violence act that became a family violence act we have um various orders that can be made under that act such as a protection order which stops the person from coming near you within so the court would say you can't come within 100 yards you can't come within 500 yards of this person it's a restraining order you can get an occupation order which is actually an order that says you can o the the victim the applicant could occupy this home to the exclusion of the um the abuser the abuser even if it is his home so a lot of times people say ""Oh god but I can't leave because where would I go?"" And the court wouldn't put him out right but the court has the power to do that and we've specifically said that that's called an occupation order so throw out your own house if you want to beat up your family um temporarily of course until the matter is resolved and and housing arrangements are made you could get uh an econ financial order where he is forced to give maintenance for you and the children right um so you could get that order at the same time you could get uh um cost to the order temporarily so if you feel like oh no but I can't leave because this man is going to keep my children and they're everything to me so the law allows you to get all of that um there's also legal aid in most of the regions where you don't have to pay for or if you do it's a very small sum subsidized legal services where you could get help to go to court we've also done it in a way where you don't even need help you could go to the magistrate's court yourself you don't need a lawyer and you can fill it up and the magistrate will deal with that and the county clerks will help you fill that up and then there is help and shelter and other shelters run by the government of Guyana through the Ministry of Human Services where women are provided with shelter for themselves and their minor children so you could go and live quietly safely in a place that nobody knows without having to worry without having to worry and you're provided with food clothes and all of that rooms to stay security security which is important to stay and then there's a 914 hotline that the Ministry of Human Services runs with the Guyana Police Force I think um where you call that hotline and you get help so there is help in all of this now the purists are going to say that I shouldn't ask women to leave and you shouldn't ask women to leave that we should tell men to stop and it's true to the men I'm speaking who might be looking at this show i'm saying you know how could you say you love somebody and every time you're just hurting them and then coming back to say sorry and have makeup sex and makeup dinners and makeup to that you are not a rehabilitation center you are not why why is the woman you got to put up with this or or or try to get him to change whatever it's very sorry i got No no no i you know why I stopped because it doesn't matter what you how you think you'll change him he has to get professional help professional help with psychologists and psychiatrists and he has to want to change and he has to want that and I'm not even sure right off of your own right for sure you can't just change because you say you want to right because this is an illness before we go because I see they're telling us around I just want to say I I think that you know at the end of the day looking at it as well and how they strip you of your dignity and your selfworth I just want any woman who is out there if you're going through something like this I want you to remember that you are beautiful you are strong you deserve so much better and help is out there for you once you for it yeah and for For me it's not should the man stop beating you yes should he stop cursing you yes should your husband treat you better yes should your boyfriend be kinder yes but you also have a role to play in how you thrive how you developed and and how you should be treated so while the purists would say I should ask men to stop I am asking women to take control of your own lives this is your life take control of it get out put together the things you need to put together to get out pack up your little dishes and your little wares and start planning your exit reach out for support it's too late reach out for support and the before it's too late for every woman who died I would say they all if you would ask them the day before not died or killed i would say that if you would ask them the day before they would tell you something like me he ain't going to joke me up he ain't going to stop me he would never do that yeah he wouldn't do that he don't go so far he's only beat me every now and then that's what people would tell you and I'm saying to you that if you see these signs get out get out you're worth so much more and we now have so many opportunities for women where you could go and get yourself educated you can get temporary jobs you can get your life it's going to be a hard decision it's never going to be easy but it's not like it's easy in the first place if you're in that situation exactly it's not easy if you're in it it's probably harder to get out of it but we're asking you to get out of it because unless he has professional help he ain't changing so that's what we want people to understand also and there is help out there for you there are programs that women could go and become business owners there are programs where you could be home and studying on the Guyana online academy of learning scholarships there are programs where you can get 10day employment um so it's it's a little bit different now about what is available to you you can still love your heart is still going to flutter when you see him passing on the road this handsome man that you gave your everything to but you owe it to yourself to come out of this relationship and your kids if you have any definitely your kids because then you you both touched brief briefly on children growing up thinking that this is normal but also being scarred by it i want to say a lot was said a mouth a mouthful was said i just hope that the women who are listening if you did not know what your if you were experiencing certain um what's the word aspects of violence yeah if you were experiencing certain aspects or charact characteristics of violence and you were not sure if your situation or your relationship was abusive we hope that we would have shed or clarified what it is now and we hope for sure that you do do take matters into your own hands seek the help you get and leave that situation help is there help is there for you and you deserve to be treated like the queen you are yeah and that's my thing too that all of us have so much value your great mothers or sisters or wives waiting to be for somebody who will actually treat you well or just a human being who wants to live out your full potential and you should be able to do that and um to the other women to the other women looking on who not the victim not the complainant but the other women around her who know don't get impatient if she complains 10 times listen to her the 11th time also don't say oh well she always running back to him to the women around you have to we have to support each other and I want you to know in us you have that friend we're willing to lend an ear we're willing to help to get you out and we're going to be patient because we understand it's a process to the mothers and aunts and cousins and friends and workmates who know that your sister or workmate or a daughter or niece is being abused be patient with them and listen to them and support them through that leaving process because it's a hard process but is one that is necessary so please do reach out for help legal aid help and shelter 914 any of the other places that that we spoke about look to see if some of the things you weren't too sure if that was abusive but we now told you that it is um speak to people around you about it and get the help you need by God's grace I'm working right now i'm studying at Carnegie i'm studying to be a seamress i'm always trying to elevate myself yeah i love doing sewing since I was a little girl you know yes so this is one of my passion health development education law enforcement policies human rights children abuse gender equality race religion politics government sex legal

RfC83tXt3JI,End GBVF National Dashboard launched Javu Baloyi weighs in,2025-03-26T15:12:42Z,UC8yH-uI81UUtEMDsowQyx1g,gender violence,ZA,0,937,0,,"let's uh unpack this conversation further now and bring in Javu Baloy spokesperson of the Commission for Gender Equality javu a very good afternoon to you and thank you so much for your time so just give us a sense then of what this dashboard is actually meant to do i mean one would imagine the data will help measure gender- based violence and femicide progress how will this then you know be done and which specific data will you be looking into thank you very much um as a commission for gender equality we welcome one of these initiative in in endeavor to arrest the sc of gender based violence we will be looking at issues not only as a commission we're looking at various issues we're not only working on the field of gender based violence and femicide the myriad of issues that we look at as a commission for gender equality but information that will be generated from the national dashboard will be of good use to the commission however we need to be also be realistic in so far Having the national council on gender based violence and femicide to be functioning that will be coordinating all these efforts that have been done by the commission for gender equality by the end gender based violence the 100 day the 100 day challenge so that you know we have got a coordinated approach it shouldn't be whereby government departments and others are not willing to give information so someone should whip us all everyone in the line to say we need to get information pro give data give data to this institution do they doing this because we have seen in pulanga that there are lot of cases that are being withdrawn because of l of DNA dialogue and the commission has engaged with the national commissioner to say what is it that we need to do look we have got two uh forensic laboratory which deals with these issues in the country and should we have many of those we can go along way in arresting at the sketch of gender based violence however the commission welcomed this initiative by the minister and the team that is working here we need also to have the national council on gender based violence and family side functioning so that we coordinate this like I've ear alluded on so the commission will be working closely with them and we will also play our role as an oversight however also the cases that are being withdrawn uh because of the investigative me measures on the ground it is of high concern we are the commission going to Pumalanga tomorrow to go back to the department of health in Pumalanga and because they have been fingered in social development by the police and NPA they're responsible for some of these issues they need also to be to to be held accountable hence we are doing that tomorrow in Pumal so we're doing it throughout the country and we had with the portfolio committee we raised the issue of 140,000 backlog and DNA test that even the national dashboard cannot do anything as long as we don't have coordinating mechanism in place and it's interesting that you raised that you know the point about coordination and I wanted to you know speak about the point on collaboration and accessibility especially because you know we're looking at this extensive uh value chain in terms of stakeholder management on GBVF matters I mean uh your concerns that you are raising now in terms of accessibility and the use of the data that is collected uh for decision decision making especially because you know there are a number of existing law enforcement systems that are already there so how will you make sure and ensure that that gap is is is closed in terms of making sure that those processes that are already existing will then feed into uh this dashboard because one would imagine if you introduce something like this that is meant to be innovative and meant to uh seamlessly work together with the stakeholder value chain it should indeed be working yes it should be working but you've even he had na raising a concern that others are not volunteering the information that's supposed to be volunteered so we having a a shortage of um accurate data which supposed to be provided what we need to do is to work in unionism and eradicate silo mentality also we need to capacitate in terms of financial and human resources all the institution that like the department of women youth personal disability the commission for gender equality and various civil society organization in order for them to go on the ground deep rural areas and get data from the hospitals from the the clinics from the police and also making sure that the police understand the sensitivity and the the the travesty of gender based violence in our country because in Pumalanga it was it's been raised that issue of gender based violence and they don't when they report them the people even HSRC report which was released last year says 5 million women in South Africa they don't want to report issues of gender based violence and femicide because it seems they've lost hope in the system or some because their cases are stale some are withdrawn because of DNA death what we need to do we need to work in imunism all of us holistic and collaborative approach we need to have as a matter of agency coordinating mechanism because SA will produce data saps will produce statistics and data ourselves will have our own and others will have their own so it's the dashboard we can all feed in the dashboard and also trust in the system and the innovative mechanism we will win and and arrest the schedule of and eradicate completely in the country however I still maintain coming together of the national council which has the bill has been passed of gender based viide it's long overdue that needs to be done if we can do do that I am telling you the dashboard will be a walk in the park everybody else will support it people will be uh very aware of where they need to report the trust and in the in the system and the work that we do on the ground as a committee for gender equality will be enhanced tremendously by all the mechanism that would be put in place and system that are geared into ensuring that you know this gender based violence as a pandemic and femicide it's it's it's it's a it's a story of yesterday in our country yeah i mean the dashboard initiative does sound you know uh like a very good initiative in fact um I think they've mentioned that there are some gamechanging results in the program so far including 98% reduction in GBV related court case backlogs you've also spoken a little bit about you know just some of those backlogs that you are also concerned about but my next question is given the fact that we we know that violence against women uh and children has been acknowledged as a national crisis and in fact uh many times we've heard people referencing it as a second pandemic so in terms of the gaps that you are also noting here as a commission speak to us about how some of the issues that you have tabled including policy uh as it relates to GBV and femicide you know uh that are proving to be problematic how would you then also feed into this system uh with some of your challenges ours it's to play an oversight role as a chapter 9 institute what we do We do research we do monitoring we do court monitoring we are not the first respondent on GBVF cases we play that oversight role but when people do not get a they're going to not get joy within the system they come to the commission for gender equality and some even when they do get joy they report to the commission that general commission we have launched a case in Manguin police station we want you to play a monitoring role and those cases will move do speedily what we'll do as a commission we'll give them our reports that we have and those that we're working on we visit various places and people are opening up to the commission we'll feed that information to the national dashboard to see you go to Palmer Magistrate Court today the the backlog is very very it's very massive you go to Pumalanga the backlog is massive eastern Cape is massive yes there could be moving but however there's a shortage of courts and dedicated magistrate and judges that are geared into prosecuting issues of gender based but the delay like have said also the delay in prosecuting gender based violence cases should also be enhanced by this um national dashboard we as a commission will work closely with them we'll play that oversight role we'll also monitor the the national board and also to give that objective and fairness to the process and ensure that we as a country move in the right direction our reports will be even given to portfolio committee and very relevant committees like we always do and that will will do without fail so that we enhance the process that children and women who are brutally and and and savagely being killed today every day in our country um also their life has spared through our our endeavor as a commission working with the national dashboard and other institutions"

Wfck82Pintc,GIRLS IN THE HOOD GENDER BASED VIOLENCE,2025-03-26T12:54:32Z,UCOwaB-QBaxPxJBO8yd2I8jQ,gender violence,NG,2,64,0,,it is a lovely day to be alive and healthy and kicking and you're welcome to girls in the hood my name is OA and I have guest with me in the studio and they're going to be introducing themselves so my name is niio welcome my name is Victoria o Moses you're welcome my name is s welcome to the program on this edition of girls in the hood we are going to be talking about a very sensitive and critical topic which is gender based violence so basically I'm going to be giving you the basis and then my guest to fully delve into the topic more gender based violence refers to any type of harm that is perpetrated against a person or group of people because of their factual or perceived sex gender sexual orientation or identity that's basically the definition of gender based violence and now I'm going to be moving on to the causes of gender based violence in the causes there is cultural factors legal factors economic factors political factors and so on they go on and on and on the where we are going to be focusing on in the program today is on the types of gender based violence and from the points that I'm going to be giving to you they are going to elaborate or delve deeper into it and things like that under the types we have the psychological violence physical violence sexual harassment female genital mutilation and they go on and on and on and on but these are the basis and where they are going to be talking about moving on to my guest in the studio what is your view from this on the types of gender based violences what are the things you want to pick out or talk about from this well okay so I'll go first you see this um gender based violence it's actually a very broad topic and just like you listing out the type we find out that there are a lot of things that can really influence this gender based violence and like you said you said gender based violence is an act that is Meed out on someone based on the gender they carry and now the thing about gender based violence is that it is two ways it's not just focused on one person alone it affects both male and both female and another thing to see is that it's not like we are having a guy against a girl or a girl against a guy it's a of even having men against men and women against women and this is where we B it BS down to that cultural Factor where we have especially cultural factor that we have um this female genital mutilation now I I heard a story of a girl that um in her culture they believe that every woman has to be caught that's in their culture they practice female genital mutilation and when technology started coming in and you know everybody was getting civilized and some people were going outside the states people younger women were no longer doing that so this is what the community women did and her mom was also part of it what they did was to low the girl from the city down to the village and just say ah just come and visit us we have missed you this kind of thing now you will establish trust this is your mom calling you your aunties and when she came she just noticed that late at night when she was sleeping they just uhuh people just just came and pinned her to the ground and then caught her that is a lot it's really a lot now apart from the pain she's going to face there's also a sense of betrayal because these were people that she looked up to it's it's as painful as being raped let's be honest it's just that yeah because you have somebody that is violating you in the process so this is something that has to be talked about it's not just a man against a woman we also have k of women against women which is not supposed to be so it's always advisable to have people that are even your own gender supporting you and being your protector so that's just the angle at which I see the O art H that's is a very very sensitive angle and the scenario or the story that you give there was quite a lot it's a lot so moving on to Victoria what is your perspective what do you want to say about this in the angle of physical violence in what I've written down it's based on inheritance inheritance is a grave and deeply rooted issue in many African countries in some societies women are denied the legal right to take action or to claim some properties whereby sometimes in some religion when a woman converts to another Religion she be the land of some properties widows for instance are vulnerable after the death of their husband they often face intense pressure from their husband's family maybe some the husbands and brothers would want to get married to them and if they refuse they refuse them of the property sometimes they might even um accuse them of their husband's death M relatives might be favor over female he despite legal provision that Grant equal inheritance right to both genders inheritance laws may be ignored to ensure that women are excluded from receiving their first share in Africa we know that men has more rights than women like some culture as a woman if you don't give birth to M children you stand a risk of not getting the inheritance the women that don't have male children will be denied of the property even the daughters too don't have access to their father's property in some cases the woman will be forced to take some actions like drinking water from her husband cups in order to prove innocence of her husband's death it's somehow kind of like trying to weigh how important a child is based on the gender not based on what the child is even bringing to the table which is wrong and it might not be a physical violence against the the person it's an emotional violence a psychological violence because this person ends up growing up and feel oh so I'm not really important that M said my education will end in the kitchen I think it's something that also people should look into and let's put an end permanently to it and shouldn't be judged based on your gender years moving on to syvia now syia what do you have to say soic gender based violence is often associated with women but men and boys also face gender violence in various context the society focus on women experience and had led to limited recognition of what the men usually face to mostly let's say it's relationship mostly between a husband and a wife you might have married a very competive wife like she carries a competition with other women in the society and is trying to beat up to their level or more than them so she might see well whatever the husband does is not enough she wants more than enough like let her stand out in the society too so whatever he tries to bring he might be coming from work he'll be really stressed out it do happens to some when they are outside the home they like find a kind of peaceful quiet environment for themselves but when whenever they are coming home they see like very like so I'm going to meet this woman again all these kind of things yeah is really telling men and for the fact that it's more focused on women they never take it serious to check out how the men are going but that part it should be really recognized and reported in the society the men to should be given an opportunity to like make decisions in their house cuz we all believe that men are the head of the so that should be properly recogniz thank you very much for your views they are very very enlightening yes from the female genital mutilation which is a very very sensitive and intense one to the recognition of male and also to The Inheritance aspect where females are denied what they rightfully are supposed to get because of their agenda and so on thank you very much for being part of the show today men can be violated women can also be violated when you are violated please do not sit in the dark do not be quiet please take these cases to the appropriate Authority so I really want to thank everybody in the studio thank you for coming Victoria thank you for coming and thank you for coming to get us in the hood thank you for watching girls in the hood please do not forget to like

hello everyone Welcome back to another exciting and informative episode of Digital Data Podcast I'm Cecilia Mundu a broadcast journalist a digital security trainer and I work at the intersection of technology human rights and journalism with a focus on countering online abuse against women journalists and women with voices online Today's episode has been made possible by the Association of Media Women in Kenya And I will not talk about Amwe because the person who heads Amwe is our guest today and we are very very privileged to have her on board So in case you have any questions after this please email them to us and we will make sure they get to her So thank you so much for being here You know it feels like finally Thank you Cecilia Please introduce yourself and tell us who you are and now give us the juice about Amwe You know I'm always saying Amwe is this Now you're the cook Give us I give you the broth Yes Yes Top layer Awesome So uh my name is Quint Tambbori Uh I am an award-winning gender equality advocate Um I'm a multimedia journalist Uh certified media trainer a love training I'm a mentor I'm a speaker and currently serve at uh the association of media women in Kenya as the executive director Um Amw as the name suggests uh is the national face the national outfit uh the nonprofit um membership association for women in the media PR coms related fields such as u academia and we have membership uh cutting across all the 47 counties in Kenya Yeah we have women in mainstream media Uh we have women in community media organizations vernacular media organizations new media social media influences We have student membership and uh what we basically do is um pull our resources Media is a very powerful tool Extremely powerful Yes So we pull our resources we pull our networks uh to advance our cause which is to use the media to advocate for gender sensitive society gender transformative society Um Amik has been around for a while It's a millennial since 1983 guys 83 the original millennials Our week has been around for a while and we take pride in you know building upon the strengths of uh women in the media supporting them uh helping them advance their mission and basically just creating an enabling environment a safe space where they can thrive Uh we are currently implementing our fiveyear strategy um 2021 2026 and we operating around five thematic areas Uh one is on media development and membership which basically means uh we our main members are actually journalists and we believe that there's a lot that is happening in the media environment in terms of you know digital evolution emerging issues climate change AI and all So we we we we endeavor to build their capacities through training you know on you know gender sensitive reporting gendered aspects of all these um theatic areas we talking about and we don't just train them we also equip them with the skills sometimes we give them grants because looking at the media environments you know things are thick okay that is that is the truth of the matter And um there's a lot of um threats to media freedom in terms of just media sustainability So other than training the journalists we also give them grants so that they can you know undertake their job which is to inform society Uh our other thematic area is on women's economic empowerment Money money money you know show me the money show me the money The reason we are very keen on economic empowerment of women is just because it is the gate path to a lot of opportunities for women out here When a woman is empowered economically they can move mountains When a woman is empowered economically they can actually get off the cycle of sexual and gender based uh violence abuse The opposite is also true because many majority of women are are trapped in you know um things that are not working relationships that are not working jobs that are not working networks that are not working because they're not economically empowered So how do we do this by connecting not just our members um but also the society to you know media organizations and conversations around how they can build resilience economic resilience around um you know uh their incomes uh how they can participate actively in terms of just discussions around economic empowerment and because our main constituents are journalists we are very keen on ensuring that we also support journalists to uh actively be involved in the discussions around economy business and we currently we're actually training journalists on how to report investigative how to do investigative journalism around illicit financial flaws which and and domestic resource mobilization which is an area that if you look at most newsrooms has been set aside for the men folk you rarely find women reporting on on hard news So we are very big on that Uh similarly we have a thematic area around um gender and governance because we want to be at the table where decisions are being made It's true Yes Yes And where are these decisions being made in national politics okay in uh on platforms where women are making on on on tables where we're talking about uh climate change pertinent issues money uh politics business sports everything Because there's always an assumption that women only want you know soft life soft news But what people don't understand we want everything We want 50% of leadership in this country We want to make we want to call the shots in terms of uh decisions that affect how this country is run and and and because again our mandate goes beyond uh our membership because ours is to focus on women who are in the media and women who are covered by the media Yeah Okay So that doesn't mean that we only focus on membership Yeah We we have a we have a bigger uh role and responsibility to society So we once again we we take part on national platforms We take part you know drafting policies memos that touch on um um women's political participation We are very very currently we are pushing for twothirds gender the implementation of the two gender principle We we we are doing whatever it takes Uh we are very big on uh strategizing for how we are going to have more more numbers come 2027 elections of women in politics in this country And we just recently launched a project uh for women advancing women's uh leadership with a partner called Akinamama Africa where we profile the seven women governors in this country And that's just the start because what we're trying to say is um we have a strategy We have a plan come 207 we don't just want to have the six or seven women governors that were elected in 2023 We want more We want 24 minimum Exactly Okay But how do we do that yes Because we're in the media Exactly So how how do we partner you know with other stakeholders the civil society organizations um governments political parties everyone anybody who cares about uh the national representation of this country we are reaching out to them let's work together so that come 2027 we have who knows maybe a female president we have 24 female governors and then ultimately we will see what you know this country of ours is missing from uh not supporting women in leadership Other countries in the region they already know the trick Rwanda Ethiopia they're doing so well including Tanzania but Kenya is lagging behind Yeah When you do not have proper representation it means there's a certain perspective you're missing out on Statistics actually show that organizations countries that are managed or run by female heads of states do very well So I don't know what's what Kenyans are waiting for And finally I think we have one more for the matic area which is directly linked to the project uh that we we are doing with the policy and other partners is on digital safety digital rights safety and security uh thing is we we know that um media in itself is very patriarchal The media environment is not very favorable for for women We we've seen a lot of sexual harassment cases and as a matter of fact SR is also another thematic area and we uh we lead the gender committee of uh the coalition of media partners in this country called Kenya media sector working group has been given the mandate to deliver media houses where there is zero tolerance to sexual harassment So pack that there So that is what is happening on the offline space But now we have an opportunity as women in the media uh in the online space The digital platforms has given us an opportunity to grow has given us the opportunity to advance our skills has given us has given us a voice a platform that we we were otherwise not getting in mainstream because if you look at the makeup of gatekeepers editors managing editors news I mean news owners they're all men unfortunately But the digital platform means that you Siccilia can actually run your own Siccilia Mundu media Yes Organization Quinta can run her own media organization So unfortunately in as much as the digital space is an enabler it is also a disabler in the front that it is also the forum where um the keyboard warriors and bullies have actually are taking advantage of women in the media women in the limelight politicians women human rights defenders and they're using the platform to sort of pull pull our efforts down you know um they don't want us to advance They use the same platform that is meant for us meant for us to grow to bring us down to attack us uh to bully us So at Amwe we are cognizant of that fact and therefore as a thematic area and just responding to you know um the emerging issues in society We are very big on digital safety and security of women want to ensure that women are well equipped with information women can navigate the online space safely and three then they can grow to ensure that the media environment we we becomes an equal playground for everyone you know I've been a member of for many years you know and let me know what you know as you were speaking I was like of there's so much to do you know sometimes you you seated waiting oh I'm waiting for them to call a meeting so that I can go but there's so much that is happening in the background that we actually me as a member you know I should speak for myself Need to put my best foot forward and say what is happening And I like what you say trying to empower women because if you want them at the table they must bring something to the table They must be knowledgeable You understand and sometimes the society holds a woman with very high standards like of or you want them to be women governors What are they offering you know yeah So I like I mean I'm very impressed I'm like of I really need to do better as a member of ARM week So thank you so much Quinttera for making time to be here today I don't take it for granted I know like your schedule is crazy So I want us to talk about the report that you recently you recently launched and um I'll start by asking you uh to tell us a bit about the report that your organization that is Amwe did on tech facilitated gender based violence and what were the main goals behind this report this research Yeah thank you very much So we did a a research on TFGBV on women uh with prominent public lives and here we're talking about women journalists women human rights defenders lawyers um content creators generally women whose lives are in the limelight most of the time And um this research as as I' I've just alluded to is one of the interventions that uh we we do at Amwe that we are very big on getting to the we are big on finding the source getting to the bottom of issues Okay because um one is we we are responding to the fact that uh abuse that was happening offline unfortunately has moved to the online space and on the unfortunately on the online space if you look at the speed at which it is moving it has been some people have said abuse on in the online online space moves at the speed of lightning it's true like a virus exactly because of the technological tools that people use to perpetuate online violence There's a research that was done by just before we released ours by this organization called kicket Did this Kenya ICT action network yes I remember I don't know it was that one and basically what they were saying is that they experienced about 1.3 billion cyber threats in the last quarter The if you look at if you do the daily math you'd be surprised So um this research was basically trying to understand this one was done on you know it was an overall research but ours was specifically targeting uh uh women and this is why because we we don't have a lot of gender segregated data in this country and yet women face very unique challenges Um two uh the reason why we undertook this research like I said is that when you have the numbers once you have diagnosed where the problem is then it becomes very easy to now come up with interventions to cure that problem because we might be out here saying you know what h there's a lot of online abuse that is happening on the on the Facebook spaces or on the X spaces where is the data where is the data because what the data shows is totally different from probably what people assume for example In our in our survey we were surprised to find out that 50% of the respondents said that they were attacked online by strangers Now 50% is a big number It means nobody's safe No one is safe And and that reminds me there's a report also a research we did several years back Yes They said seven out of 10 Seven Yes Seven out of 10 out of 10 journalists women journalists have gone through this online Yes Exactly And you know when you look at uh the nature of TFGBV it is a moving target It is not the same thing It could be one thing today and then a few months later it has morphed into something completely different Like in our case we were surprised that WhatsApp as a forum came up as one of the platforms where abuse against women was being perpetuated at a very high high value Yeah And so we were asking ourselves um why WhatsApp and then now you know the the researchers went to the ground and they found out that it's because of the way you know it's very easy to privately message someone on WhatsApp It is also very easy to engage in group harassment in WhatsApp and a lot of people don't even know that they harassing people by their interactions on the online platforms Okay Yes Yeah So it is one of those uh researches honestly speaking that we undertook and I feel like there's a there's still a lot more to unpack from it Yeah Because if we are to mitigate TFGBV then we cannot just rely on one research We have to keep doing it We have to keep diagnosing We have to keep refining until we finally come up with lasting solutions Yeah You know there's there's um a research I also read some uh time back and they were saying like um there's no enough data to inform you know because when you go to policy makers you need also to give them numbers this is and the number of people but why don't we have numbers and the lawyer who was here the other day said a lot of people don't report not because they don't want to report but also the reporting mechanism is another thing quinta what I found very interesting about the report is the I think it's 48% of the people who are asked ""Do you think that online abuse is real abuse?"" They said it's abuse but it's not a crime Yes it's not a crime 40% Yes They say it's not a crime So it's okay So what are you saying what do you mean by when you say it's not a crime so so we've normalized it It's been institutionalized Yes So you'll get over it And these are some of the things that we really need to work on So uh what is what is the uh impact on this kind of violence especially on women journalists you who works at the core of it all you know Cecilia um until TFGBV happens to you ask me I've been a victim until it happens to you you might overlook in fact I'm not surprised that the the respondents who said that the 40% said it's well it is not it is it happens but it well it's wrong but it's not a crime that that was yeah it's wrong but it's not a crime and the other there's also 50% of respondents who say that well it happens but they do not have proper reporting mechanisms in their organizations and we talking about um media organizations as well as learning institutions here we we talking about students So let me allow me to refer to some global data that says not too far from what we found out actually that 58% of women globally have been have been victims of technology facilitated gender- based violence And the most surprising bit of this is that the first incident of TFGBV happens between the ages of 14 and 16 14 and 16 These are high schoolers Yeah Yeah So can you imagine and I'm not surprised because at some point there was a very weird trend uh happening on Tik Tok where you know school children would gang up against one of them you know on the Tik Tok platforms shaming them and yes there were bullying there was a lot of bullying happening so first and foremost TFGBV like any other form of abuse has lifelong consequences lifelong it does uh emotional for women in the media Yeah it is even economical because when uh one of the one of the outcomes I would say consequences of TFGBV on women practicing as journalists and media practitioners is radio silencing They just decide you know what this space is not um favorable for me so I will just mute So tell me Cecilia if I am um a content producer working on a weekly show every week and that is my my main state that is my source of income and because of the online abuse and harassment that I am facing I decide to go mute I decided to uh quit the online space altogether for my we say for my own peace of mind In Kenya we Yeah We say in Kenya in Kenya we say it's never that serious isn't it yes So what happens to my economical empowerment so that means I'm out of work isn't it yes Okay Put that aside There are many people who are depending on me Say I'm a family person I have children who are going to school I have maybe I have family members who I'm supporting So the moment I interfere with my source of income what happens to my dependence that means they have no You see the impact Now that is just econom economical uh impact Let's go to the mental health aspect of this TFGBV has led to women committing suicide or dying by suicide TFGBV has led to women journalists getting into depression Okay TFGBV has led to women quitting the newsroom altogether and going to shago We have seen it or getting into you know forms of addiction because of one or two or two things that somebody said about you Sometimes they're not even true or because somebody shared your intimate pictures on the online platform How do you recover from that how do I show my face today for example I'm the ED of Amwig Somebody has shared my intimate photos for everybody to see How do you recover from that will people ever take you seriously and already society is very unfair to women because we are judged twice as harsh as everybody else if not thrice Yes Now if you look at the numbers of women in the media even though the numbers of women who graduate from training institutions to um mainstream is actually high They say four out of five but there's a lot of hemorrhage And one of the reasons why there's hemorrhage in the media spaces for women journalists is because of harassment sexual gender based violence which TFGPV falls under And you know so Quint uh when I was lecturing some of the things that I would hear this young journalist that we are training like of I'm not sure I want to be in mainstream media is too toxic And then I realized we might lose the voices of the next generation We talking about it being patriarchal right now and TFGBV among other things is going to make it even more pat because if they say no I don't want to be part of that space and you who can blame them anyway because we also we also don't want to be in this space whereby it's so toxic and uh you can agree with me we've made so many strides especially when it comes to issue of sexual harassment Yes Yes you know you gender you know how much work you guys put in because now you know when you look at these young journalists I'm like of they don't even know how much you know like they found the space so much better and that was that is our responsibility to make the space better than than we found it so I want to talk about the intersectionality how does tech facilitated gender based violence affect different groups of women because this research not only dealt with journalists which I found which I found very profound because we're only talking about journalists When I started digital data podcast I would only interview journalists and then somebody came and told me you think it's only women journalists who are going through it and then I was like oh my So I found this report very interesting because there was the issue of women human rights defenders So what is the uh like how does it affect women from marginalized community or even women in politics yes Um I remember in is it in 2020 sometime back when um I was undertaking some consultancy around women in politics um interviewing women in politics in Kenya and Nigeria and one thing that we found out is that um abuse is abuse TFGBV whether it happens to journalists it is the same TFGBV that will happen to that will happen to women politicians is the same one that will happen to like in our report in our research we even looked at um TFGBV that affects women with disability Okay So it is the same the same kind of abuse I think what what the the the the common denominator is that as long as you are a woman in the public space and I think that is why we went you know all out to not just focus on journalists because we we are cognizant of the fact that um there's a lot of targeted um abuse toward women who are in public space and the these include the journalists this include uh women politicians this include uh women who are women with disability uh women human rights defenders activists the social media influencers and so on and so forth is that abuse is abuse The form in nature is the same The the keyboard warriors the attackers the perpetuators they are one and the same It's only that now with different um with different uh groups we tend to see maybe uh the form in which it takes probably varies For example um the women we interviewed who are living with disability they said that the abuse that happened offline sometimes it actually uh um manifested on online No that happened online Manifest manifested offline Yeah they followed up They followed through and ensured that these women were physically attacked Okay So you see um so for us I'm looking at a scenario It's just that Siccilia the only challenge we have is um in this country and I believe this is a problem that affects third world countries is just lack of resources Yeah Because with good resources we can actually get to the bottom of TFGBV and one of the reasons that uh we are not even able to tackle these issues is if we are not even prioritizing uh the what abuse that is happening offline Okay We are not even serious about it We're not even serious about following through um to ensure that survivors and victims get justice Okay We do not have proper legal frameworks We have legal frameworks that were established many many years ago CG 2016 you know they've not been revised to outdated They outdated They need revisiting They need um reviews okay so that they can respond to the current needs So if you're not even serious about the abuse that is happening offline now we have this new thing called TFGBV By the way nobody has even agreed about on the definition of TFGV Okay when you ask a lot of people they'll be like it's not violence And that is I'm not even surprised because um what is the procedure of reporting TFGB and who will take you seriously because the same people who are supposed to be giving you justice don't even understand what this animal is Exactly Yeah So it becomes such a it's becoming such a complex issue and um I feel like in this country we do not prioritize anything that touches on gender and the problem people think that gender is about women Gender is not about women Exactly People think when the word gender just involves women It is just that right now we are the ones who are receiving the short end of the women are the ones receiving the short end of the stick But you never know with this Mela and interventions we making You never know what will happen in a couple of years and you'll be having you know men sitting on this other side and advancing and advocating oh we want two/3s gender rule You never know I mean it is not our desire We advocating for 50 and I mean a gender equal society but you never know what will happen a couple of years from now So if sometimes we just need to do the right thing because it is the right thing to do Yeah We need to be serious about uh the legislative framework around sexual um and gender based violence including TFGV in this country We are not serious And the lawyer was here She broke it down very well because when you listen to what she says especially in terms of even when it comes to reporting sometimes you don't blame the victim when they decide to choose themselves and say you know what it's okay it has happened to me Let me just take a step back but I'm not getting involved in this further So you said it very well when we started Media is very powerful What is the role of media in all this because one of the reasons why I started this podcast is TFGVB was so invisible in mainstream media In fact I remember someone coming telling me that post you've started Are you sure what you're talking about i'm like what do you mean that's not violence you know like I mean even if you go through it you know take down some time get over it and get back to it So what is the role of media in all this because I mean we we are so powerful you know Yes Uh media is so powerful that we are actually our mandate is entrenched is embedded in the constitution of Kenya and not just one legislative framework We have article 33 We have article 34 We have article 35 And other than just informing the public um ensuring that the public have access to the right information the media mirrors the society for me that is the bas the most basic um definition or illustration I could give of the role of the media but it is not we don't just reflect you know a reflection gives uh the picture the image as is okay maybe just inversely but ours goes beyond that because we set we not only set agenda but we build agenda The reason why we are called the fourth estate is because we play a critical role in holding duty bearsers accountable pushing for reforms following through with promises that have been made by not just government institutions Okay we really have to put everyone uh on the spot Okay Ours is to set agenda build agenda hold uh duty bearers accountable Now when in matters of sexual gender based violence which TFG GV is part of we are also I feel and this is just I'm putting a disclaimer Name shame Name Yes Name shame abusers Because one of the things that um I've noticed Cecilia is how there's a lot of focus on survivors and victims The media puts a lot of focus on survivors and victims who more often than not are women Unfortunately so it's uh when we when you're experiencing femicide in this country for example what do we see media sensationalizing victim shaming you know asking women and families what why what were you doing going to meet a stranger in the middle of the night our own president said can you teach your children to be disciplined okay so nobody is ready to be accountable you know we are always just casting blames and putting burying our heads in the sand now media plays a bigger role because other than just reflecting that the society has a problem okay the way way we handle uh women the way we handle gender related issues the way we handle SGB in this country is totally improper It's unacceptable Okay How do you allocate a 100 million to deal with a historical issue we're talking about patriarchal attitudes but you allocate 100 million and numerous task task forces Can we ask ourself for the first time in the history of this Kenya what is wrong why are we having issues of femicide happening in the 21st century why are young women or young men killing each other there is a system breakdown Can we fix that system breakdown instead of coming up with palative measures mead no no no no no no That's not going to help You're trying to do all of that to treat there's a cancer Cecilia Now to treat a cancer you have to get to the bottom of it Yes you cannot just be busy you know giving painkillers right left and center That is what this country is doing when it comes to matters of sexual and uh gender based violence including TFGPV and it goes back to what you you you started by saying women are not at the table No we are not there So we are waiting for this men to make decisions for us but they don't know where is the issue you know it's it's um when we talk about period of poverty it's only a woman who can understand what we're talking about Tell you my friend yes you're the one who wears the shoe Exactly Yeah And one more thing uh the other thing that media can do in this matter of TFGPV other than just holding everyone accountable is to put um because in the daily agenda thankfully I I come from I've transitioned from a newsroom So I know that there are meetings that I held to discuss what is going on the front page and to plan for the agenda of the paper Can we make sexual and gender based violence a priority in our newsrooms not it should not be we should not be responding to incidences of femicide and women who have been you know killed because of one thing or the other We need it needs to be proper because other than the debts there's a lot more that needs there's a there's so much content around SGV there are policies there are champions okay there are guidelines so there's so much around sexual and gender based violence that we've the media has barely scratched the surface okay so let us prioritize reporting of SGBV and two let it be sustained okay not just we need We'll report about an incident where somebody has been murdered and then we forget about it Let's sustain did this person get justice Okay And why didn't they get justice what is happening and finally media cannot work alone It has to be a multistakeholder Media cannot work alone to win this battle So media is the watchdog We will come in to do the reporting We will be the whistleblowers We will report incidences when they happen We will try and hold um governments institutions accountable but we need everyone involved We need the civil societies involved We need organizations um we need the um we need the the judicial system of this country They have to work We have to work together We need other stakeholders We need everyone on the table We need the goodwill of the government Okay Let's start by even employing a a cabinet secretary for gender and affirmative action you know ministry It's not there We don't have it So can we get the goodwill because from there now we'll get down to coming up with policies that will support um you know implementation frameworks and whatnot because the thing about this country is when then we we have very good policies but there's a a lapse between policy and implementation two an implementation is king Yes Yes Yeah And two is that if something is not on policy then what would be our okay where would we be agitating from what would be where would we be fighting from what would be our supporting document what would be our backup because when I have a policy when we have a two-thirds principle then we can walk to parliament or we can walk to the responsible ministry and stakeholders and ask them But you said this needs to happen Where is it so rather than just you know argue arguing and advocating from the air we ne"
"d to have laws and policies that advance and support what we are fighting You know we always we need to ask also ourselves a very uncomfortable question Why don't policies work and you said it very well Sometimes they're just there to tick a box but they're not uh being implemented And something that came out very clear also in this conversation as we talking is we need political goodwill to make this thing work Exactly Because if we don't have political goodwill then well I'm I'm I'm I'm hoping that um as we go by Yeah So you talked about a multistakeholder approach for it to work because media can work cannot work alone So let's talk about the support system What kind of support system legal legal emotional psychosocial need to be in place to help survivors of tech facilitated of tech facilitated gender based violence how can these systems also be improved yeah Uh maybe I can just mention something that um um I've I've been I've been thinking about and this is first to hold the big tech companies accountable Yeah accountable Um the thing is when it comes to these matters of uh digital safety and security of everyone your your safety is in your own hands because they already they already have their their privacy um principles on the online platform So as long as you have sub subscribed majority of us are too lazy to read through you know through the fine lines It's like reading terms and conditions Okay We we always we always just will tick you know the the box if you agree with the terms and condition which we rarely read Okay So the other day I was in Iasha just having a session with the female journalists and I was as I asked them so do you know what for example uh meta what they do with your data yeah Have you read through the the privacy the terms and what is it called terms and condition terms and conditions Yeah What do they do with your with your data and surprise surprise I can comfortably say that 99.9% had not read through the term the terms and condition So basically we are lacking in the dark Okay We are very excited about these platforms which is good because honestly speaking for me social media is a is is a beautiful tool particularly for it is a game changer It is a game changer A lot has happened We've noticed campaigns h I mean life-changing campaigns have happened via Facebook Things that we would not otherwise have done using the mainstream media income Oh my god See how young women are empowering themselves on the online space Exactly And you know as you said like uh the media right now mainstream media things are thick Yeah But with this space young female journalist can employ They can survive Yeah So but that said it doesn't mean that now the big tank companies are off the we can leave them you know they cannot go off the hookuh because a lot of have you ever tried reporting abuse on any online space Yeah How is the process first of all you wait and then after mine it was like a few months Oh it didn't violate our community standards Yeah Now you see so basically they're more into honestly they don't really care about your welfare The advertisers are the king makers Yes they're in business They in it for the business So how then do we hold these big tech companies accountable for me that's a discussion Maybe it's a discussion that we can have at a at not not even just at a national level at a global level Yeah Because uh these issues affect us across the board It doesn't matter whether you come from Kenya Uganda Tanzania This is one of those issues that we really need to take seriously and to push for to hold the big tech companies accountable Uh secondly um you asked me about how I mean when you look at how what kind of support do we need um we need to resource we need a lot of resources um to manage this fight against TFGV and here we are talking about not just monetary support we're talking about you know having pulling our resource let's see what we have what can AMI bring on the table what can you know Kenya union of journalists bring on the table what can um nongovernment mental organizations bring the diplomatic community what can they bring on the table okay let's see what we can do together um and support each other in this fight otherwise I'm alone okay with our very limited resources it is almost it's like a drop in the ocean it is a drop in the ocean okay and then the other thing that honestly I feel needs to be done in this country is mass digital literacy mass digital literacy because there's a lot of ignorance There's a lot of um many of us experience um I don't know whe you call it digital blindness or digital uh we do not know how to navigate that space or we think we know how to navigate the digital space Uh right now when you look at the uh the forms of media we're not just talking about traditional journalists We have citizen journalists people who will see things how they will report the best way they know the news Yes They will report the best way they they know Sometimes it's so it's unethical Okay So again uh probably this needs to be a national campaign driven maybe by the ICT ministry How do we engage in mass digital literacy maybe partnering with the with the big tech organizations because people need to be informed uh matters of misinformation disinformation you know do you know where it it is perpetuated the most it's just forwarded as received That's that's the best thing we know My grandmother in the village she doesn't know about factchecking isn't it so those are the platforms that for example during our research it came out that the politicians it is those platforms that were used to perpetuate abuse against them And it's sometimes it's out of ignorance People don't even know they committing ab abuse um uh female politicians of course they are judged harshly So one incident which is maybe you drawn from many many years ago is picked it starts circulating on the social media platforms it goes viral viral on WhatsApp what happens to this lady it means that even the people who want to vote for her now their judgment is compromise like how do we entrust you to lead us when you are behaving irresponsibly okay so for me it's that digital literacy it is one of the agenda that we need to take a position because if you look at the the internet penetration level We're talking about over 40 million Imagine okay in a population of about 50 million or 60 and and people who have access to you know mobile phones and internet subscribers This is a cuz sometimes you have you have two phones three phones Yeah you're talking about 60 million So those numbers are high Okay And like I said even for politicians if um the tech space is actually an enabler for them it's a good tool that they can use to campaign but at the same time it can pull them down It can And you know I interviewed uh someone a digital security from Irex Ephraim and he really emphasized on the issue of digital literacy You know Quintter we believe because I can read a message I can even get to read this one I'm very digital literate You know when you ask you tell people in Nairobi digital literacy they're like what don't we know but unfortunately it is a very core issue especially when it comes to issue of digital safety So I'm glad you brought it up So let's look at the future Yeah Yeah The future outlook on this issue looking ahead What are some of the positive changes you hope to see in both the tech industry and society when it comes to tech facilitated gender based violence i know you've touched a bit on that but what is one thing that you really want to see on this space um well s I'm I'm a big advocate uh for human rights honestly and um ultimately even our constitution ad advocates for you know vows or pro you know is very has said in chapter 4 that everybody in this country should enjoy the maximum level of their human rights Okay So what tech facilitated gender based violence or TFGBV does is basically it takes that away from you because you start looking at you start um you start analyzing self censoring yourself your productivity goes down so I'm looking at a scenario in the in the future where we can engage productively on the online space without abuse Okay Uh I'm looking at a situation where in this country we have laws that we can follow through to the end laws that we can refer to I'm looking at a situation where if in the unfortunate event and likely event that we have experienced some form of gender based violence or online violence then the survivors and the victims can get justice without fear of victimization and intimidation Okay m because we know again that the perpet the perpetrators of online violence or SGB for that matter most of the time it's power play is the people who who wield power okay any kind of power it could be that at that particular time they are the ones who you know when they're behind the keyboard they feel so powerful the trolls exactly so um I'm looking at a situation where we can get adequate justice for all victims and survivors of online violence Because one thing I've realized over time is when one case is mismanaged Then you silence numerous other people who have faced the same abuse and they will not speak up And you know what that does it denies them their freedom of speech their freedom of association It basically denies them their freedom to life Okay And you know in the media space TFGV is a big threat to media freedom like you mentioned Maybe when we deny uh journalists and this not just women journalists when when deny journalists the right to effectively perform their job the society is the one that is losing Exactly When journalists self censor themselves it is a society that is missing out on accurate information on good journalism because many good journalists have left the space very good journalist they have left because they cannot deal with it Okay So it is a big threat to media freedom and one that needs to be given so much attention Let's not even start talking about the mental health issues because um journalists are not okay They are sick Okay From many other issues many other issues media sustainability um media representation okay sexual harassment and then now we have TFGV I can imagine what will happen The messenger is sick Yes the messenger is when the messenger is unwell the messenger is sick How are they going to deliver the message to society so the people who are losing out is actually the society So mine is just to envision an environment a media environment that adequately look can report sustainably on TFGV can take care of the messenger looking at the safety and security We actually we are welcoming everybody to join armwork so that we can start looking at the welfare of journalists in this country because many people just focus on how the job is done and they don't care about who is doing the job Okay And I think sometimes it's because of the way we've been conditioned It's only the job that matter the rest that's why we don't it's I mean it's just the other day when we started talking about mental issues you know and still therapy up to today is seen as a very lucrative like like you know spoiled mentality and all that It's bougie It's bougie That's the word So what is your final uh message uh what would you like to leave with our viewers and listeners with regarding the importance of addressing this issue of TFGV well um it's sad to say but your safety and security begins with you It's a very sad situation You know you remember when our former president says and I remember one time I said that in a meeting and people were like of no what are you saying it's true You have to take responsibility Take a bit of responsibility And I I know you're a digital expert I have used some of your content in the past to train Sometimes even just coming up with a strong password It's as simple as is as simple as that Okay Just uh navigating your dig looking at assessing your digital footprint Yeah A simple exercise I always like telling people is go to your favorite browser and and look yourself up Yeah And if you if you don't like what you see then that's a that's a good place to start Okay If you don't like what Google or Chrome or anybody else is saying about you that's a good place to start because you have the power to control your digital footprint You have the power to tell rewrite your narrative The online space will it feeds off what you feed it or what other people feed it about you So you can control that Many of us have we especially journalists we have exposed ourselves They have exposed our families our loved ones our networks All in the name of ignorance Okay Yeah Yes Especially those close to us Those close to us Yes And goes to the issue of share renting There were Yeah And people don't know about it Exactly Yeah So this unfortunately your digital safety starts

z42RxZDNASE,Kenya39s Femicide Crisis A Woman Is Killed Every 24 Hours Njeri Wa Migwi,2025-03-26T08:53:23Z,UC0kFUQNwtbKJlfzTfj4x4YQ,gender violence,KE,10,711,5,God Bless Njeri for her work Shes the last hope for so many women children and men who are victims of abuse   Here in South Africa its 3 women every single day Three   Its unfortunate that she cant differentiate homicide and femicide,"this morning we're having a femicide conversation and we're talking about the disaster that's femicide in the country um a number of things have been set up already well a number of things have been said in terms of what is being done to end it or at least bring it to a head that's a totally different conversation and joining us this morning is Jerry W migui and she's a human rights Defender and co-founder of us Kier and she's here in the hot seat with us this morning Jerry good morning good morning how are you doing I'm all right yeah as much as I can be as much as you can be karibana to the hot seat of The Situation Room you've not been here before but we're glad that you're here this morning because we're talking about an issue that everybody has spoken about in the last few months the president has said a number of things about it County members of parliament women reps have said you know 100 million Shillings has been given you know we're going along those lines but let's look at the really um the nitty-gritty of this um from um a defender's point of view but before we do that CT will give you today's proverb as he does every day and I'd like you to interpret that for us and tell us what it would mean to you is that all right okay okay our Proverbs are from the Islamic Republic of morania before one Cooks one must have the meat right that's it that's it oh you going me tell you another one no no um so you said before one Cooks one one must have the me yes these people are big on meat Meats right yes clearly um I suppose for me it would mean you can't cook when you don't have anything to cook okay yeah and I suppose um let's say for example I can't where let me just put it that way you you can't you can't do anything if you don't have something in you you can't walk if you don't have legs yes well you you can be raled that's not walking yeah but really truly you can't if there you don't have anything of substance then you know what they say then you can't speak right okay thank you for that it's interesting to hear people's perceptions and people's interpretations of different things it's wonderful how the human mind works let's look at this femicide ISS issue um and let's look at a couple of things as we get into it a task force has been set up we know this had happened by the president's hand after it seemed as though the cases of femicide had become you know quite crazy 22 was the number at mid February of the number of women that uh had died this year this year 22 by mid-February Kenya's violence epidemic is what some of the headlines are saying about this femicide in Kenya William Ruto has set up a task force Rebecca Chap's killing highlights dangers of femicide in Kenya a woman is killed every 24 hours Kenya's femicide nightmare femicide is not homicide and renewed new actions urgently 2024 the worst year for femicide in Kenya as cases saw to 170 2024 a year marked by femicide in Kenya and this is the reality of what we are talking about today we had a forensic expert here in the studio who gave us definitions of what feminist of what femicide is and that there had to be a link between the person who was perpetuating this death and the relationship between them and that is why it would be deemed femicide if we could not make the link between the person who took her life and what kind of relationship they had then it would not be deemed femicide it's deemed femicide when something has happened usually of a relational nature between these two individuals okay from where you sit because we know that you have been very vocal and very Hands-On around this matter what on Earth is happening with this femicide issue in Kenya um you know one of the ways in which you determine how a country deems its women and also how a country is doing is actually by The increased number of women who are killed by him you know femicide um there is a correlation between the same um anytime you hear stories of gender based violence anytime you hear um so many cases and I I could I could uh use covid as an example uh where cases of gender based violence were on the increase is and it was a lot and we all heard about it and we know this because um 320% was the increment of gender based violence in Kenya and when the economy is on a downtown one of the things that also increases are as I said femicide that is just one reason but we can't just blame solidly the economy on the number of femicide and the increase and the increment of femicide um we also have to look at holistically at femicide because they actual subsets of femicide even within femicide itself um as you said you had already gotten a definition so I will not go there but we can also look at other ways in which femicide in which we determine how femicide looks like one of them is increasingly how the bodies are disposed publicly gruesomely and just like garbage that is actually a very big indicator and a marker when we're looking at femicide and if you have seen uh from 2024 and even this year other than intimate partner femicide which is number one femicide in Kenya uh 74 to 75% of femicide is actually intimate partners and I would like people to keep on remembering this because a lot of times it's sensationalized that you know they went to an Airbnb and she was killed and so on but a lot of times it is a case of gbv and I will keep on saying femicide is a culmination of unchecked gender based violence when there is nothing that is somebody has been abusing you consistently and constantly threatening to kill you they finally do it and that's why we always say that femicide is wholly preventable it's not like any other you know homicide you know somebody comes and shoots us that just because we women is not doesn't mean that that was femicide but femicide if you think about it is entirely preventable if the government was serious about eliminating gender based violence then we would not look at femicide so the owners is on the government to actually prevent we did see the other day uh during a funeral where a woman was actually violated on the day when she was supposed to be burying her husband and if it wasn't prevented she' have been killed that would have been femicide you start to see that femicide is even there's even cultural femicide there is do related femicide where you killed because somebody feels like I pay doy for you I I can do anything to you I own you and and so many other subsets that are there we've seen uh for people like me we've seen on a killing where her family feels like the girl did something wrong and maybe she stepped out with somebody who's not of the same religion and as such she deserves to be killed we have had women come stay with us entirely this is on also on the on a killing where she was threatened to be killed she managed to run away baten very badly and she stayed with us until we were able to get her asem to leave this country because the many she should have stepped out she have been killed by her family they vowed and yet you find that these people never get arrested these cases never get CAU and nothing is entirely done why why why do we see such horrible things happening and um we don't see law enforcement coming into play number one there's a lot of cultural stigma when it comes to issues of gender based violence we don't report we don't talk about it and we really love turning a blind eye it doesn't involve me we have a famous saying in Kenya M it's not my business you know your neighbor beats his wife you know there's violence in that house you've seen it but you know she goes back into that house so I really don't want to be involved until she dies and then we are called and then people are like we would hear her screaming now she's dead but why do you think our people behave in that way why do you think our people uh turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to something that is clearly wrong because people number one especially when it comes to issues like intimate partner violence domestic violence you will find like people are like I don't want to be involved because she's going to go back to her husband and if she goes back to her husband then I'll be left in the middle of it that's one reason the other reason is a lot of it is based on how we we we've grown up and how it is always a culture of Silence around issues of you know societ what Redeemer societal issues like if you really think about it gender base violence is an acceptable societal ill you know he's beating his wife but needs the wife she's beating the child but she's the child so how is it my business so essentially we condone gender based violence we do see when you talk about uh gender based violence let me just go into some stats that have pulled up real quick um 170 women victim of femicide in 2024 I would talk about um femicide being an intentional killing of women just because they are women and then we have 7,100 cases of gender based violence that was reported the year 2023 and this is according to the prime cabinet secretary Mia mudavadi but even as we talk about all this we know um at a time in this country when women got out went to the streets to demand that Justice is done by them and the law enforcers those who should be at the front in making sure that femicide cases gender based violence are dealt with or is eradicated in the society were at the Forefront in lobing taras against people who are considered to be victims do we think or is there hope that our police are able to deal with femicide cases and gender based violence cases as should be done I will come back to say that the person is political it's a choice they made a choice I was on the street I was one of the people they Lobby here G I was one of the people they beat and um it was a choice we were not out in the street being you know what um the constitution of Kenya allows us to be out on the street it does demanding our rights as Citizens to be heard and as women when we went out on the street we were asking to be heard had and nobody was listening to us instead we were beaten we were teargas we were even arrested um the police know what the law looks like so there is no excuse you can't say you're a law enforcement officer who is supposed to keep the law and then at the same time you are the person on the street breaking the law so they know that they should not have been on the street bitting us mhm and um what did the government do they transferred the ocss of Central or whatever it is that they did that was it not an apology given to us no compensation no nothing nothing the government said absolutely nothing and yet not too long after before that the president himself the head of government came out and said look this is an emergency it must stop he has a gender advisor in cabinet right and um there was this wonderful sum of 100 million Shillings that was then given out and we saw women Representatives who now were the vanguards of this uh Kitty and I don't know what was supposed to happen after that um if tents were set up in different counties where people were supposed to then now be able to come and report I don't even know what that was supposed to do but then we did hear some noise you know there was some Rumblings of something and I don't know I guess my question is is throwing money at the problem going to solve it what is it a money issue is it a money issue that resources are being sought after to be able to handle this thing of women being killed as a result of you know number one problem being relational issues is it going to solve the problem first of all any and any any of the number of the people that I saw been given that 100 million have nothing to do with femicide never heard of them never had them speak speaking about gender based violence never had them speaking about femicide let's start from there most of them wouldn't even give you the definition of what femicide is um how the money was going to be used or was used cuz we don't know was to set up tents in different counties and talk to women barazas was yeah set up barazas and give the women a little bit of Fair Soda and a scarf that is how the money was going to please tell me how that is going to help you're talking to the people who already victimized that's number one you're not talking to the people who are the would be perpetrators um most importantly if it is a resource problem shouldn't the resource then be used to actually help um the government of Kenya does not have any shelters or safe houses places of Refuge where if I am let's say for example I've managed to escape from my house uh from nearly being killed and I'm seeking a place let's say I go to a police station do you do you know what happens to a victim yes unfortunately let's just say I'm reporting it's in the middle of the night do you know where the police would put me sell thank you I would go into a cell the purpose of your being put in the cell is so that what happen for safety I see and these cells which have other people already yes so if you're seeking safety in Kenya today as somebody who's running away from an issue of gender based violence that is if they live and listen to you M you will I have rescued a girl uh who was in a Cell together with her grandmother what had they gone to the police she had been ripped oh yeah and it was in the middle of the night and there was no resources for the police to actually take her to hospital so they called me so I came and I found them in the cell and I took them who called the police yes they do sometimes do call me ah so they know you a little bit yes if you were to provide an alternative suggestion how should the 100 million have been used can you imagine I think people don't understand how underresourced because I'm always in police stations and because I've also followed the budget line to understand how the police are resourced how under resourced police are can you imagine what would have happened if that money was used to reinforce and resource the gender desks even provide psychosocial support to police themselves because I see the things I see but I'm able to go and get therapy I also assume the same thing happens to the police in the station can you imagine if they had even bothered 100 million can give you a shelter yeah or if they had even bothered to come to People Like Us who are not in government and told us hey because Jer you run a safe house for women how can we as the government help capacity build your shelter Maybe additional beds maybe give you uh a psychosocial support so that the women who come here can be given psychosocial support what if they did that in all the 47 counties to ensure that there's a place of refuge and a place of safety yeah where people can run to but no the government didn't do that if such a thing were to happen under which Ministry would these activities take place the one that doesn't have a CS yeah the one that doesn't have a CS gender gender gender doesn't have a CS no no really yes what happened we don't know one was never ever have a it did it did the other regime oh I see so we have a Ministry without a c but we have a PS yes yes I think so yes no we do I should hope so no I know we do yeah I know we do so who does she report that's a good question anyway that was me so I think that also just tells you how issues of gender and you see gender is not just women how issues of gender are taken in this country it's very lightweight if there is no Direction the you know the head that gives Direction going downward then who cares and actually a lot of times you'll find that that Ministry is where civil servants go before they leave government right so is that why more women and and and I please hear how I'm asking this question and is that why more and more women are being killed in this manner because there's no attention there's no consequence very few of the cases that we've seen let's just take the the 22 from this year alone how many of those perpetrators have been brought to book have they been found are they in trial have they been punished these are 22 lives we are not saying that would be fatalities we are saying women who are dead we're not talking about the ones who've been attacked or you know abused or beaten these are women who are dead so if we do not see that you know the department that should be actually taking care of these gender issues and it's again like you said it's not gender is not women gender is gender you know across board if this is not happening at the very top is that not why more are being killed because nobody's going to do anything it's not going to be given attention no one cares we just there shouting and speaking we have the beginning of 2024 we held a March and in this March we gave demands to the government and told them what we expected the government to do and it was important for the government to actually recognize femicide as a national crisis and as a person who is in gender-based violence I keep on saying we need to recognize gender-based violence is a national crisis after the 100 million Shillings was given did we hear anything else no because you know what happens constitutionally is that when you declare something an emergency what you essentially have done is that you've unlocked the permission for resources then to be spent thank you that's what you've done but now after those resources have been spent what happens uh number one it was never declared a crisis number two there's no research that has been put there is nothing that has been done other than setting up a task force which is Kenya's answer to any problem we set up a task force we know everybody in this room knows the task force are essentially just an answer for the government to tell you shut up and then there a report will finally if ever will finally come out and it will be sheld and the government will say they have actually tackled the crisis of femicide there is an educational task force isn't there there's an education there's a task force for anything you mention it there is I'm I'm I'm pretty sure there's a task force for anything anytime the government feels threatened or oh now you oh you're now coming down on us this side oh let a task force and when you ask what does this task force solve there is never an answer we don't need another task force we already know what needs to be done that 100 million could have simply been used to conduct a very robust campaign all the way down to the Grassroots all the way down to the villages to the barazas to speak about G based violence because there people who have normalized gender based violence as you have seen when I was talking about their funeral they were able to beat that woman without feeling like there would be consequences because she didn't throw soil on her husband's grave exactly they made her eat soil this woman had a Cs and they beat her and so many I don't even want to talk about you know the 100 million is the one off mhm but that was it yes but the problems that we speaking of not a oneoff no they recurring problems so a oneoff can't actually even begin to solve the problem goes to speak about the government being intentional in handling matters to do with gender based violence I know we're going for a break but even as we go for that break let's just remember that in this country to handle a femicide case it takes 1,900 days 4 years for a case to be concluded we're looking at the issue of femicide in the country today and uh 2024 was called the worst year for femicide in Kenya with 170 women dying 75 let put at 76% of those are intimate partner um issues that somebody has taken a life because of what they thought to be infidelity or somebody has has you know jealousy has played out here and other things have come um out as a result of that the question is what are we going to do what are we going to do but but even as we talk about the meaning I mean the the reality of of femicide and we even have talked about the what brings it about what we're discussing is not what brings it about the increase in the reports and the incident of femicide are not have reached the proportions are alarming when every other day you read about something and you you have to wonder what about things that have happened and we don't know about and we haven't read about absolutely so to your question we clearly have a femicide problem yes we do now there is solving the problem as we see it now and there's ensuring that this is not something that becomes comes entrench in our culture because the normalization of violence against women contributes significantly to this absolutely yes and neither can we say there will be very a lot that you have to going to do to convince me that those who are taking the lives of these women are okay on the mental health Spectrum you you cannot convince me that the LI because we've seen some brutality take place when we're talking about the deaths of these women it is not easy to we we I mean we've seen testimonies of people who've killed and they talk about the fact that it was not it's not an easy thing to do to take another life it's not so you too cannot be on that space where we say you going to kill somebody and wake up tomorrow morning and walk around as though somebody and something is okay so what am I trying to say here is that there's a deeper issue that we are not looking at here that what takes you to that point where you take another life whether it is a woman whether it is a man whether it is a child but these are now compounded by other issues whereby maybe you are in an intimate relationship with this person and you have seen that the best solution at this time is to take the life of this woman wouldn't you see that that's a problem um I am a very big person on Mental Health but I'm also keenly aware that punishment is a deterrent to crime and um before we went on break he said it takes 1,900 and something days for a femicide case to end and I want to break your heart to tell you I have so many pending cases and nothing they're on mention and I will start with a case that is very personal to me because I got the body and this is 9-year-old maryan boy killed in KY by a 33y old and a 36y old you know uh brothers who were the children of the landlord of that building where she was killed they lured her they sent her to go and buy something for them they got her into the house they ripped her they killed her 9year old yes 9-year-old I was speaking to her mother yesterday evening and um we are in court we've been in court for 2 years and the case has never moved Beyond mention mention s we've been before three judges and the case has never moved Beyond mention so for clarity when we're talking about a court a mention is that it comes before all the parties that are um in the case come before court the court comes and says acknowledgements that there is a complainant and that these are the individuals who've been named then as defendants and we will now hear this case on set date yes that's is a mention when everybody goes home yes all right and so what happens is once it has been mentioned it's supposed to go into hear so for 2 years we've never gone into hearing we are into the third year this year and the case has never gone beyond mention let me ask that's just one case I mean I have to ask this question we're using this this 9year old MH was led by these two mhm individuals yes they lived in the same plot yes because their father owned the building they lived in or the the reason I'm saying that is because they were the children of the owner of that building yes and he used his money and power to one ensure one of his sons disappeared and the other son is in mare Hospital under claims of mentally unstable yes okay it's femicide so this child died yes she was raped and killed yes we say it because it's important she was ripped and she was killed and by the time the people came to report to us because our office is near there I removed her from under that bed cuz they stuffed her under the bed you see her mom was looking for her the only reason her mom found she found her in that house is because she saw her Crocs outside the outside the door and so she knocked and when she knocked nobody answered so she tried to open the door said no you can put in your hand and open and she saw blood and she couldn't proceed so they started screaming and we were alerted and we came the girl was under the bed with um oh you know here to here it's one of the most painful deaths that I have SE yeah embedded in her and that is how she died and we have never seen justice so if there is no justice for people for Mama wab we are in court we've never been heard I do agree with you that and a lot of the 170 cases that you mentioned from last year only 30 are in court so there are 140 people in this country who have killed somebody and they're just walking around absolutely we have people in this government who are in court because of claims of femicide Sharon Sharon atino and her unborn baby deserve a mention in this table because nothing has ever happened and yet the person who is assumed to be the perpetrator was voted not once but twice in government and nothing has ever moved that case even though the court declared last year the last year this year that he had a case to to answer to but how long did it even take for us to say there is a case to answer to okay um there is uh okay of course it's a wash with comments this morning just taking a look at our socials today and um One Duncan on demo is asking that we provide the case number for the kyola case he would like to follow up on that so maybe that's something that we can share just the case number at least and uh there's nothing wrong with making that public um and just looking at quiet I it's just the it's is it is Despicable and that's when we have to say that something can be window dressed because that in my I think we we need to call them out for what it is that something can be window dressed and some money be thrown at it and the assumption is that something is done but this is the reality from what you're saying if 170 just from 2024 have um been recorded that's what has been recorded we do not know how many more have died in last year we don't know and just another that the 40 the bodies in quar are not included in the 17 in the 117 all right now if only 30 of those cases have gone to court I have to ask myself in what warped world I'm if we just going to take this 9-year-old precious person as an example and say that her case has just been given a mere mention in court it's been 2 years going on three I also do believe that one of uh that that punishment is a deterrent to further criminal activity but if we don't see that happening then we are going to see more numbers of people dying that's just the truth that anybody who looks at the scenario and says well I'm in a difficult place and I need to Snuff this life out of this person the likelihood of me being arrested or anything happening to me is very low so I'm going to go ahead and do it or even at the very least threaten it and that is the society that we are breeding those are the people that we are breeding by not doing anything about these cases we are breeding a society of people who then find it easy to take life and it comes back to the question that I ask until these two gentlemen probably get tired of me asking what value are we placing on human life and not just as the people who take the life but the people who have the power to do something about it what value are we placing on human life if we can answer that question then it will be easy for us to say well then let's put a rush on these cases let's make sure that security appar apparatus are up and running let's make sure that security agencies are actually doing what they're supposed to do let's make sure that you can walk into a police station with and ask for a P3 and nobody's going to ask you for a sexual favor because that's exactly what we're talking about here remember we have a situation where successive governments have shown us that every time the citizenry raise an issue there is a response yes you have a genda issue given a genda desk mhm problem solved if you have some other issue you're told we're going to set up this it is set up finished because we've raised this issue in this studio before the Police Service the polic men and women who serve in it are terribly terribly terribly resourced and imagine someone who telled and yet the burden of dealing with all these things rest on their shoulders on a this is what they deal with on a daily basis yes plus many other things picking up dead bodies picking up rotting bodies every single day so let me ask on the scale of 1 to 10 when somebody comes with a case that there's been violence and somebody has been beaten where do you think this will fall in the in yes in order of priority they will listen and say okay is it more difficult because and is it more difficult to deal with um a lot of these cases because they're multi-layered and I say multi-layered in this sense that there's the legal aspect there's the law but then there's also the cultural aspect there's also tradition there's also the thing of you know whatever happens between me and you in a relationship is nobody else's business so it there's so many layers to this thing so then it becomes difficult I put difficulty in courts because we have heard cases where you know police will say well we cannot come in between that and maybe you guys need to now be able to sort that in does this make it more difficult to then be able to deal with these cases for the cultural context yes because um two weeks ago I was dealing with a case of a one-year-old who was once again ripped and killed 9year Old again one one one year old actually she she turned one the day she was being buried and and um yeah one year old yeah that's where we are one and um I have to say that that context was very deep because this girl was 13 when she got pregnant 14 when she gave birth the mother of the child and uh she lived her people gave out to get married excuse me to the person who they said was responsible for the pregnancy who was also another teenager so this is just a terrible situation all around so they couldn't they were kids they're kids so they didn't get along you know there was also a lot of familiar interference and so on and so forth this girl couldn't go back home so she got the nearest person to marry her so this is a person who defiled her baby I want you to realize this is a 14-year-old with a baby who does not even know that a baby's being no a 14-year-old is a baby yes so she kept on saying my baby is crying my baby's crying there's something wrong and so she she was told to take this child back to your people you know where you are married they need to see could be the reason that this baby keeps on crying so she takes the baby back to where she was married before they are the people who discover T so the Mother-in-law takes the kid to the hospital and they discover that the child has been defiled over and over again by this time it was too bad they did take the child to hospital but she died that night do you know what they did nobody reported the child was buried now and you know they try to do M reconcile the 14year old and the 15-year-old it's crazy the whole story is insane but these are things we hear on a daily basis and I didn't even I can't even start to explain the context when it comes to that because there culture there is I don't even know there's a lot that whole case has really messed my head cuz that child was buried at but what does it say about us as a nation as a people that's what I'm asking because the police service them I can understand because the very things that happen to them them they violated them they are actually mistreated I'm in complete agreement yes so by the time time such a person is being put in charge of other people what do you think they are going to they're going to violate people as well they had stick from once they come yeah or from when they approach issues is one that already has taken a complete left turn simply because of what they experience in their lives on a daily basis it's like they don't have any protection for themselves now you come to the citizenry and it's like we ourselves have also been violated and abused to the point where in instead of calling out something and saying you know this is this is wrong you need to take a stand you you ask the parents of these two teenagers what on Earth is the matter with these people a child getti"
"g pregnant is violation enough start from there that child's life has already changed in the most dramatic way possible and the parents decide that the best thing to do is to marry the 14y old to the 15y old so you have to ask what happened to these parents what got them what trauma do they what are they walking around with and then you see City when you even go to report such cases um most of the time you go to gender desk poly care was set up but you get there what po po care then again you get there and you're being asked to please narrate the oral AR fresh so you have to relieve it before the police officers before they get the statement you know you know the people who man those desks should actually have some psychosocial training training yeah psychosocial counseling training because I I want you to imagine I'm telling you this as somebody who deals with gender based violence and goes to those police desks and finds other people waiting with other cases so by the end of the day they've listened to so many cases unless yours is actually really really bad you know the one that they're like you you know I promise you half the time they they already frustrated because you've listened to somebody who was beaten you've listen to somebody who was raped this is the reason they tell you come with your rapist come with your rapist yes they do so you have to go convince them to come to police no I mean just the absurdity the absurdity of such a request even those 70 cases of femicide are the ones that are recorded the ones that are not recorded it's crazy are many more Jerry I need to ask you this because it's we're not even we're not even working at Cross purposes we're in different galaxies here when it comes to the real issues of what is happening the the the the women that are dying and when we say women here we're talking about a one-year-old baby yes we're talking about a 90-year-old grandmother because it does go across the Spectrum so when we have a government who has a gender advisor that sits at high cabinet level we have an entire Ministry doesn't have a CS we have a you know security agencies who tell you to come with your perpetrator and then we have 100 million chillings thrown at women reps and say you know set up and give somebody a handkerchief and an armband and have a Baraza and then that's done but then we have the reality on the ground we have all those things happening ribbons and flowers but then we have the real on the ground and we say we need to stop it every now and then somebody will give a speech and say stop in femicide but what's the message that we trying to put across today for real for us to understand exactly what's going on and what really needs to be done in my opinion we'd rather not touch it at all than to pretend that we're doing something about it yes but what's your message today that femicide is real it's a crisis and it needs to be addressed with urgency because when one more woman dying because of something that is entirely preventable if this was a pandemic if these numbers were read the way the numbers for covid used to be read we would be in crisis if a bowler came to Kenya and in 6 weeks mid-February that's when the 22 the numbers are higher than that by the way far far higher than that we should be at 40 something what being read the way we read we would be very very worried cuz everybody would be be like oh my God it would be it would be me next but we don't have that we don't even get the sense of the urgency I remember when Seth nyako died and she's a daughter of an MCA and even to date her killer has not yet been arrested that's a woman in power and the killer of her daughter has not been arrested what does that say about the rest of us and the kind of danger that we are all living in and if we don't treat gender-based violence I will start there because once again what we are seeing is the Apex when it comes to gender-based violence is femicide and after femicide is always genocide I just hope people know this that we normalize the killing of women that is how once we start seeing women as disposable that is when you start seeing children being disappeared and being killed and then men I hope we take this with the weight that it carries this is actually a political crisis and the government should not be in power if they citizenry are being killed and they do absolutely nothing about it giving us toothless promises is not going to end femicide we need the government to mount a robust campaign to explain what is gender-based violence what are the consequences we need to see cases moving in court we need to see action we are tired of speaking we need to see things start to move how can folks support the work that you do Jerry I mean it sounds crazy that that we have to say okay fine there's government in place and things should be done but how can folks support the work that you do I say this we have three ways in which we ask for support one of them is we need your money we can't do these things without your money it takes money to go to police stations to bury people we bury women some of these women killed by femicide we as aimi have buried them we have a pay bill please contribute you have skills give them to us you have time come and volunteer it's a tough one um to to have it in the headlines but then to actually interrogate it it's tough and the hope is that really something has to be done cannot continue like this we absolutely cannot we want to thank you for being strong on another day to come in and have a conversation with us about the work that you do and the things that need to be done in this country Jerry migu is a human rights activist and um runs Kim Kim and we've been talking about gender based violence we've been talking about femicide and the disaster that it is in this country and the hope is that something will start to click this is The Situation Room the only way to start your day""",,,,,,,,,,
N5gEx5rw-GE,Nota Baloyi is at it again THREATENING white South Africans with violence,2025-03-26T07:33:23Z,UCo-3Qu7AoKwo0co8v79mcYw,gender violence,US,4469,59595,1598,As a white South African we deal with this continuously it is so sickening  Nota will be the first to run into the sea when chaos breaks out in this country Just a coward  this makes me so mad  they can say whatever they want  if we do what they do we get arrested immediately two tier justice   Ronalda Gouws is up for say hypothetical things he is being charged with hate speach but malema and baloy can say what they want to double standards from our own government  True racism at its finest  You are spot on the button again  He will not be prosecuted  Has Ramaphosa silenced Malema  he supports Malemas rhetoric  As a white South African i no longer feel like i am part of south africa yes i was born here but feel alienated And its a really bad feeling There are some decent black South Africans in South africa but the majority hate us  Im a black South African and I can say that not all of us think like this theres a huge portion us that believe this country belongs to the people and also acknowledges what the whites have done and continue to do for this country in a sense of economy growth professionalism etc please know that we respect you and your culture and we are very greatful  The problem with his words and Malemas word spike the farm murders after there utterances  This is the same rhetoric that were spewed over the radio channels in Rwanda shortly before the mass killings started Thank you for spreading the word,"hello folks I really don't like covering this sort of thing but this is important because of what's going on with South Africa president Trump's executive order and media lying in South Africa politicians lying about um it's a safe environment for people in South Africa it's not for all South Africans things are bad crime is rampant 21 23,000 murders per year that's more than the United States by 50% a country that's one sixth of our size it's pretty frightening situation for South Africans gender-based violence It's a Wonderful country with wonderful people but the lawlessness is out of control corruption um you know Witnesses being murdered left and right by be de Kanan assassinated simply for doing her job uh it's it's pretty frightening stuff but white South Africans are really Under Siege despite the lies of the government and a perfect example of this is you have something called the South African Human Rights Commission which is supposed to ensure the Dignity of South Africans by taking people to court for saying things that are wildly inappropriate or racist or attacking the dignity of human beings there's a gentleman named Noto booy who's a music industry executive who um said the most horrific things we reported on last month in a conversation in which he said that white women were genetically inferior to black women they can't bear children he said that white people are genetically inferior because they have Neanderthal DNA and he said that white people need to be treated like dogs and trained like dogs to behave um the videos are out there this is not my claim this is horrible what this man said and he's at it again and um what happened the first time well the South afcan Human Rights Commission under great pressure from South Africans finally intervened after ignoring the situation for several days and they said that they were investigating it well they said that they're hoping for a decision that leads to him making a public apology and some retraining about racial Justice or you know relations between races this is nonsense the South government destroyed the life of Vicki momberg a woman who was nearly carjacked and was in shock when she inappro and insultingly referred to a black police officer using the k word repeatedly the woman was in shock was never considered she was convicted and sent to prison as a felon for the word she used she didn't assault anyone she didn't murder anybody she didn't intimidate or threaten anybody she simply reacted while under shock and went to prison for the word she said now I submit to you that a society that that legislates language is not a legitimate Society a government that is afraid of words is an illegitimate cowardly government however with that in mind that is the law of the land in South Africa this gentleman is saying the most horrific things that that harm the Dignity of white South Africans in fact white people all over the world and he suffered no consequences for it this has happened well over a month ago and we've seen no update from the South African Human Rights Commission whatsoever and you won't see it so now he acts with impunity and listen to what he says now about white folks listen to what he has to say now he threatens to kill white people and then he tries to back away from it no no no no I didn't say this now to his credit the host of the program distances himself from this immediately which is smart because anyone that stands with those calling for violence against people but especially against minorities is a reprehensible human being let's take a look at what he has to say white people came here they need to assimilate to our culture not the other way around it's bad enough we speak their language with a proficiency that they cannot even must white people came here they need to assimilate estess he means South Africa that's the interview um well so did black people black people aren't indigenous to Sou South Africa the co andan are indigenous to South Africa and that's a loose term indigenous they weren't even there you know a couple hundred thousand years ago other hominids were so if anybody's indigenous it's not the tribes who came down the Great Rift Valley about 1,600 years ago you're not indigenous you came there too you didn't fully adopt the koinon cultures so maybe you're the interloper there my friend and besides this dude looks un awful lot like he might be Koy himself look at the freckles I wonder how much European DNA he's got in his body there interesting to note look at that light skin color H Dude Looks like he might just be part European the great group he's rubbishing yeah and um wow the insulting comments that he speaks English better than white people do well offer Connors is not their first language so maybe he's got a point there but english- speaking South Africans he speaks it better what a condescending ass hat this guy is let's listen a little bit more what he's got to say they still need to assimilate to our culture they need to assimilate to Ubuntu that's the only way in which we can coexist within this environment otherwise we will Slaughter all of them drive them to the Sea literally they need to assimilate they need to adopt umuntu otherwise he will murder them he will drive them to the Sea seriously this guy just called for violence against white people murdering them now it's not hyperbole it's a message it's a clear message to others to act what else can you take it a reasonable cogent person could only take from this this man hates white people and that he's calling for them to be killed now this is different than Julius m sing and kill the boar song which he can at least claim as a struggle song and a Heritage thing from the struggle against aart which is all Horseman or but he can claim that at least and the courts have ruled that's the case shockingly but what is this guy defending how can he possibly support what he's saying here wow if you don't become black you'll be murdered is what he's saying and then watch the coward back away from it and try to cover himself because he realized what he just stepped into he realized he just stepped in the crap that could lead to a prosecution so let's see what he's got to say from here it might not be me it might not be me calling for it I'm not a part of that thing I'm just allowing him to talk it might not be me you see the coward backing away this scrawny little runt who has a big mouth and makes racist threats against people but he's not man enough to step up and defend his threats no one should threaten anyone else it's a criminal act but the host says hey it's not me I'm just letting him talk smart move brother don't be associated with this nonsense because this conduct is reprehensible in fact if white people are being driven to the Sea I'm least likely to be in the front lines driving them to the Sea well on that point we do agree Nota if white people are being driven to the Sea and murdered by black South Africans ostensibly that's your argument you're making uh you won't be at the front of the line right because of my disposition what is your disposition as in um a privileged black person in this country so why would you want to drive white people to see if you're just as privileg as they are got to love the host that's brilliant why would you want to drive white people to see if you're privileged you're rich yeah it's unbelievable um the host is spoton what a stupid comment from this guy but hey stupid is the stupid does Life's lik a life's like a box of chocolates right stupid people should wear signs that way you wouldn't ask them questions and the host well you definitely got the controversial guy on here I bet this gets millions of views on his program you want to drive white people to the see if you're just as PR as they are personally the majority of black people right have been oppressed by white people and the white system the majority of black people been oppressed by the white system what white system is that are you talking me the apartheid system National Party most South Africans weren't even alive during AP partti most South Africans were born after AP partti they've only known one governance party and it's been the African National Congress except for briefly in some municipalities and the Western Cape for an extended period of time the rest of country has been under complete dominance of thec since since 1994 a majority black government a constitution promulgated and implemented by a majority black government if there's oppression they're being oppressed by the African National Congress not by whites how are whites oppressing they don't control Leever of power they don't have the sole Authority for the use of force they do not run the courts they do not run the government they do not run the military it's run by majority black South Africans and this dingbat doorknob is saying that majority of blacks have been ressed by whites that's factually a lie folks the purpose for doing this video is to show you what South Africans have to put up with this gentleman will suffer no consequence this Vicky mber was put in prison as a convicted felon her Liberty taken from her because she used a slur against a black police officer after nearly being carjacked and murdered and she was in shock this guy's not in shock he's sitting down comfortably spewing his racial hatred threatening the death of white people because of his lies and his Ed worldview this is a dangerous dangerous precedent to allow people like this to spew racial hatred like this now in America we would just ignore some idiot like this we don't have we don't have restrictions against speech although he could be charged with inciting violence because that's a very tenuous line where what he said there here in the US in a state he could be charged with inciting violence but if you want to be an idiot and say racist things that's your prerogative we simply don't associate with morons we ostracize them we don't invite them to community events and people don't asso associate with him but in South Africa it's a crime where's the outrage where's the bench warrant for his arrest there's nothing happening in South Africa whites are not in any danger really if at any point they decide that they want to drive people to the sea I will not discourage them so he says he's going to kill white people then he says well no not me not me not me not me it'll be other people I'm not going to be in front of that but then he'll do nothing to protect white people what kind of human being are you I spent my life defending White brown black people all over the world saving lives white brown and black why would you not intervene to protect people whose lives are in Jeopardy what kind of scumbag are you apparently of the highest order well there you have it folks Noto Balo once again running off of the mouth suffering no consequences for his actions the arrogance the cheek this is what South African is dealing with this is just one example of someone who's actually well-known a public celebrity and this is what he gets away with so when s Raposa tells the world that Donald Trump is mistaken that there's nothing wrong we don't have to talk about the 140 plus race-based laws in South Africa or the exclusion from employment or education you simply need to look no further than this sort of nonsense what say you South Africa and for the race baiters and the race haters are going to come in here and and post their garbage foot sack an objective cogent elcid person would look at this and say this person is acting the fool and is saying dangerous things that endanger people's lives that's the bottom line cogent Lucid people will look at us and go this is wrong someone needs to talk to this gentleman and stop this but it won't happen cheers"

nsiCd5jqLBg,39Really concerning39 rise in sexual violence among teens Jess Phillips says,2025-03-25T20:35:47Z,UCoMdktPbSTixAyNGwb-UYkQ,gender violence,GB,34,2495,0,,thank you very much for being on the program with us uh today so you're here to talk about the number of domestic abuse victims who then go on to take their own lives because the number has been going up isn't it yeah so uh the home office uh and the mpcc uh have uh been undertaking This research for a number of years that I mean in in one regard we have the data on the number of people who die by Suicide rather than the sort of more famous dat that is the the women who were killed by men um but yeah I mean uh every year it would seem that the number outstrips uh the number of homicides even is the number of victims of domestic abuse who then di by Suicide the thing that really shocked me about looking at some of the numbers is firstly in these cases how many of the domestic abuse perpetrators were known to police but also the number of times the victims or or the the couples had been in contact with other services as well Mental Health Services for example I mean yes so one of the things that the report identifies is the risk factor with mental health in both the cases of the perpetrator and the victim uh and like you say that they have been heard by multi- agency risk assessment conferences and uh they've been in touch with the police before and so in that regard that is not dissimilar to what we see in the cases of classic Ides and that is fundamentally Got To Be A system that is sought to change so in looking at this data you can't just be glad to have the data finally or like you know the the government has to look at exactly what the strategy has to be to ensure that you those multi- agency groups and all of those services that are meant to be working to prevent this from happening are actually working and so the violence against women and girls strategy that the government um will publish uh in the summer it will will be very very alive to what is in this report and what are you going to do then I mean look it's not going to change overnight any of this um I wish that I could say that I I will make every Social Work response brilliant overnight that I will make every police officer response brilliant overnight what we have to do is look at the fundamentals of the systems of prioritization on things like domestic abuse so you know classically the police haven't had as part of their um as their performance datea violence against women and girls that that that you know hasn't been taken seriously yes like we have to make it be taken seriously but with systematic approaches so I I don't want to preempt what we be in the strategy but if you look for example at what we've learned from some of these deaths like um the case of Renee UDA where the call out to 999 led to her not being protected on the night she died what we see in that is that we need we need Specialists within the 999 call centers so that is what we're putting in place but there are what we have to do is find wherever in the system a victim or a perpetrator uh comes forward and is known to services and ensure that that that access point leads to action and that is what a cross government strategy has to be about in the minute it feels to me like we're talking a lot about toxic masculinity and I'll be honest because it's a phrase I kind of hate because masculinity is not a bad thing right you know masculinity is great it's men being men is fine but are you worried about men being radicalized online particularly in relation to how they view women look if I look at the data of the growing number of um sexual violence cases amongst the age group 14 and 15 as a policy maker uh I you you have to take very serious L the growing number of cases in that age group 14 and 15 years old 14 and 15 years old both victims and perpetrators um and but then as a mother of teenage Sons uh I also have to you know be very very alive to not wanting to not wanting to just make like all boys feel like they are the problem so it is the government's responsibility to look in whether it's the violence against women and girls strategy whether it's other things around prevent and other forms of radicalization to look at what is happening with our teenagers and make sure that we are providing the education uh and Al the protection and prevention there was one interview in a quote you gave that really struck me actually where you said once that your partner's generation was more Progressive than your dad's generation but the same wasn't true for your son's generation no I mean and and I I well I don't feel that when I talk to them about your particular but if anything I find a bit too Progressive at times it's annoying um but um age group but but there is if you look at the the sort of data and uh attitudes um around things like feminism and the advancement of women there there is really concerning Trends and I think we always thought it would just progressively get better like and it's no comment on either my father my husband or my sons who are all absolutely cracking which is what most people would say about all of the men in their lives um but that that generational progression was the thing we expected but we have to we have to look at the data and the concerns and the fears uh amongst whether it's extreme violence um perpetrated by teenagers um and like I've already said the sort of sexual violence figures and and really take that on board have you have you watched adolesence I have watched it yeah what did you think uh I wish that I could say that I was as shocked as everybody else was in that sort of first episode where it is sort of revealed and he looks so young this lad and you can't believe it if if you were to you know spend a bit of time doing the work that I've done for the last uh 20 years and and anytime in the sort of Mind of the the center of policymaking at the moment I would say at the home office real concerns about you know whether it's child abuse online people being exposed to masses of pornography like whatever it is there is a real concern so I mean I said it was a brilliant drama and brilliantly realized and I think it's brilliant that it's starting this conversation all HED off to the writers and the creatives um but they have absolutely hit on something that we are concerned about

mid30s as an active feminist without being fully aware of how little medicine knows about female bodies and I'm making an assumption that if you've made it this far in the podcast you don't take issue with the term feminism but just for the people in the back we define feminism as the social and political movement that advocates for equality between sexes and if you've been listening so far I think we can all agree that medicine does not treat the sexes equally my mom also went to college in Boston and was involved in feminism and progressive politics but for her that involvement meant immediately becoming aware of how little medicine knew about her body and giving her the information about what she could do about it so why did I miss out on this information how did the feminist agenda change so much what's happening to your body we don't know cuz we never really studied the female body say it's all in my head but the research is quite spotty no we never really studied female body i go to the doctor to get dismissed try losing weight you're just anxious that's fine math's cool i'm not pissed just wait 10 years for a diagnosis psychossematic you're so dramatic hysterical emotional hormonal eratic heart disease chronic fatigue depression and anxiety do you have pain no you don't well it's episode 8 and I can't put this off any longer i have to interview my mother for this podcast she and my dad live in rural Maine still in the same ancient farmhouse on a mountain that they raised me and my sister in it took no less than half an hour to figure out how to connect my dad's Bluetooth headphones to my mom's aging laptop but we got it done i'm exhausted now i can't do anything i don't know how you do this Kate it's very hard and I don't get paid very much so hi Mom hi Kate i wanted to talk to you about your time in Boston in the 70s and early 80s what brought you to Boston well I was going to college in Boston yes not in Boston exactly yes i was going to Harvard i know you know that that brought me there and so you're interested particularly in the whole kind of women's health community thing right yes mom but traditionally you let the interviewer bring that up oh oh okay so you get to Boston how do you get involved in feminism and the women's health collective well I should back up a little bit because I got involved in feminism before I went off to college and I read this book that totally blew my mind and changed everything that book was Beyond God the Father by Mary Daly and this book basically introduced me to the concept of the patriarchy it was like I had no clue so you don't come from a family that is necessarily steeped in this right no I don't your grandfather was very much a conservative and feminism was kind of bursting onto the scene at that point which was the early '7s but I read this book and you know when you read a book and it just kind of blows the top of your head off yeah I do like I thought okay this helps explain a lot this helps explain why I feel so uncomfortable in the sort of traditional female expectations for being a girl and dressing fem and all of that i never liked all that i was kind of primed when I got to Boston the next year there was so much going on then that was the fall of 73 there was such a thing as the women's community there was so much activism going on when you say activism what did that look like women were setting up health clinics that were woman- centered rape crisis centers there was all kinds of work going on around abortion rights and reproductive rights i pretty much quickly joined this Bostonbased group called the R2N2 which was reproductive rights national network and I was involved in organizing marches and rallies around reproductive rights roie Way had just happened oh wow yeah but women on Medicaid could not get abortions if they were relying on Medicaid so that was one thing we were working on what was your relationship to doctors and the medical industry up until this point you know I don't really remember thinking about it very much actually and I had that luxury because I was pretty healthy but I remember being frustrated i didn't feel like I really knew that much about my body and how especially my you know hormonal system worked at that point there were all of these little collectives springing up all over the place collectives nonprofits dealing with women's health it was to encourage women to understand more about their own bodies not to just be relying on male doctors and this medical system that really was based on doctors courting the knowledge and just telling you what to do the idea was let's all figure out what's going on for ourselves and be able to make choices about our care there must have been at least three or four of them in the Boston Cambridge area one of them was the Boston Women's Health Collective which put out our bodies ourselves which you're familiar with right yes we had it in the house yes we did i went to this Women's Health Center and took a class they were giving on natural birth control because I wasn't happy with being on the pill i didn't like what it was doing to me it was pretty wild set the scene for me what were you thinking what were you expecting i was a little nervous I will say because I had no idea what to expect and it doesn't look like a clinic or a medical center that looked pretty much like a bigger house and as I remember you go upstairs and there was this big room and there was a group of maybe 15 of us taking this class all women and the instructors were women maybe three different women this was when my mom was about 19 her sophomore year of college everybody sat on the floor in a circle instructors included we talked for a while and then they got up and brought in this box and they handed out speculums to all of us oh god that's really 0 to 60 this is the first class i don't know if it was the first class but it was this is kind of how the classes went and then the next step we all pulled off our pants and underwear and were sitting there in the room looking at our own cervixes using the speculum and the mirror and I mean what I remember is it was kind of hilarious everybody was like laughing but there was also just this great sense of oh it's not a big deal everybody looks kind of the same more or less and it's not like unspeakable this part of your body people would crawl around and look at each other's cervix you know and did you have any idea that like that's what this would involve when you signed up for the class or like showed up no it's not like they describe that in the description of the class did everybody just seem on board i don't remember anyone like making a scene and storming out or anything like that i think people knew this was the atmosphere this was the kind of place this was i mean there was just this huge importance put on women being together in a safe place and being able to talk about everything relating to gender and sex and birth control so I think anyone who was going to sign up for this class sort of knew what they could be getting into so you had this class what happened next well I helped start a women's newspaper at Harvard it was called Seventh Sister it's where I first learned about printing and layout and I ended up becoming a graphic designer were you publishing health related stuff or was it mostly political it was a mix we even had reviews of plays and actually me and a rag tag group of friends put on a play at the experimental theater that was called a womb of one's own oh we wrote it ourselves this one actor was the uterus and we had a few guys in the show and they were the sperm dressed all in white i mean it was pretty wacky i do wish I could have seen it it does sound very fun it was great it was great and not that different from a play that my friends and I put on in college called Vagina Play right exactly so you did all of this incredible political work that was tied into women's health and body literacy and women understanding what was happening with their bodies and having the information and sharing it with each other discussing it together that was so clear and so important and then 30 years go by my sister and I are in college going into the world and that kind of political activism tied to women's body literacy doesn't exist what do you think happened honestly I don't know and it's a very good question because at the time we felt like this is it this is changing everything we had faith that this was going to turn things around i've come to feel like in America in particular it's all about pendulum swing the 60s and the 70s there was just so much happening and so much change especially when it came to gender and women's rights and reproductive rights and then there was a reaction to it and look at the reaction now i wondered had this kind of major progress and then backlash happened in women's health before we're going to take a quick break and then we're going to go even further back in history than the 1970s if you can imagine such a thing [Music] welcome back to Cramp if you look at the last 50 years from the time my mom was in college to now it seems like a lot of progress was made in the push for awareness and advocacy around women's health and then it seems like it kind of fell away i wanted to see if this was a pattern if there have been other times where there was a big push for better medicine for more awareness of how medicine was not serving who it claimed to serve i consulted a book that was actually first published back when my mom was still living in Boston a book called For Her Own Good originally published in 1978 authored by Barbara Erin Reich and Deardra English who were also active in the Boston Women's Health Movement i have an addition that was updated and republished in 2005 and here's what I learned if you were a woman living in the colonial US you would have depended mostly on a female lay healer for your healthcare these were women in your local community or in your extended family who knew about herbs and how to treat common complaints women typically relied on other women around them for care for everything from fever to childbirth and pregnancy complications knowledge about how to deal with sicknesses and treat conditions were passed through families and communities down through generations and across hundreds of years into the early 1800s healing and herbal knowledge from Native American practices oldworld European knowledge and African traditions brought over by enslaved women were all used they would just vary depending on the climate herbs would grow in and the cultural makeup of your area healing wasn't just about whipping up an herbal medicine for your cough or making sure a pregnant woman lived through labor the person helping you give birth would be your neighbor who knew you knew your husband knew your kids knew your situation and the particular challenges you faced the herbal medicines and interventions might not always have cured you but they probably wouldn't do you any harm but there was another kind of health practitioner that you started seeing more and more of in the late 1700s into the early 1800s men who called themselves regular doctors who charged for their services there were no formal standards to be able to call yourself a regular doctor and regular doesn't mean normal it just means like professional regular doctors were more like a club where if you were accepted into a medical school or if a doctor took you on as an apprentice you could be one so that meant no women could be in this club it was almost entirely upper class quote unquote gentlemen and their education wasn't exactly scientific medical training was mostly about arguing how to categorize diseases and reading ancient Greek medical texts you know the famously accurate Greek texts where they conclude that anything wrong with a woman means her uterus is wandering around inside of her body in fact this kind of medicine was often more about proving that the doctor could have a bigger effect on the patient's body than the disease which meant they would do things like bloodletting until the patient passed out or making the patient get blisters by applying a mustard pus things that would make a paying patient feel like the doctor had done something even if it didn't actually heal them ultimately you'd have been way better off going to a female lay healer for help with whatever was wrong with you and these regular doctors were pretty annoyed that a lot of their potential paying patients would just go see a female lay healer in their community rather than call in a doctor and pay him to make them sicker so in their clubs they started to dream of a world where it would be illegal for anyone outside of their club to heal others and they were getting what they wanted between 1800 and 1820 17 states passed licensing laws that gave medical societies the power to grant licenses in 10 states unlicensed medical practitioners like female lay healers could be fined or thrown in prison but this backfired in a major way workingclass people who for generations at this point had believed in the ideals of self-reliance and independence they did not like the idea of legally having to pay someone to give them ineffective medical care women knew from experience that these doctors didn't have a clue how to help them and a movement started forming women met to exchange home remedies and medical knowledge they formed more organized ladies physiological societies where they learned about female anatomy which sounds a lot like the class that my mom went to but this wasn't just a women's movement in 1822 a farmer from New Hampshire named Samuel Thomasson published a book called The New Guide to Health in which he basically just wrote down all the stuff he had learned from a female lay healer and midwife named Mrs benton he published it instead of setting up his own medical practice because he thought every person had the right to be able to heal themselves this book was hugely popular and I really hope he cut Mrs benton in on the profits if she was still alive there were these friendly botanical societies that popped up all over the country where people could meet to share health information and learn more about herbal medicine this movement became known as the popular health movement and along with other health groups at the time they fought against the medical licensing laws and they won every state that had enacted a licensing law either softened it or replaced it during this time this push to put medical information into the hands of every person was successful to a point it fragmented over the years as popular movements usually do regular medicine eventually adopted enough of the practices of evidence-based healing to become more attractive to people and industrialization meant less people were living in tight-knit small communities that had female lay healers eventually medical licensing did become the norm but the popular health movement was part of what made medicine improve enough for that to be acceptable so this backlash against an upper class club of doctors who had monopolized health care but weren't providing adequate care it has happened before it seems like at a few times in our country's relatively short history we've come to the same conclusion the established medical field is not working for us does not serve us and we want more information and autonomy we want to be able to make informed decisions about our own health are we back in one of those moments today to understand more about where we are today and why we seem generally less aware of medicine's shortcomings when it comes to female bodies I talked to someone who has been there for it all i'm Laura Prito i am the program director for Our Bodies Ourselves and I am also a professor ammerita in history and gender studies at Simmons University in Boston if you'll recall from my mom earlier Our Bodies Ourselves was a book we had in our house and they were also an organization that taught body literacy classes to women in Boston in the early '7s our bodies ourselves is a guide to the bodies sexuality and health of women and gender expansive people it is now a digital resource so it's a website but it has a long distinguished history our bodies ourselves as a book is one of the iconic books of the 20th century it helped launch the women's health movement one of our founding principles is that we are experts in our own lives that combination of trustworthy reliable research-based information about our health and our bodies is put together with our experience and what we know about ourselves to try to inform people so they can make better decisions about their lives and their health so we are carrying that torch still many years later over 50 years later from your perspective within this organization and as a women's health historian what happened why didn't I get this awareness that mainstream medicine doesn't really know very much about women and doesn't seem to have women's best interest or quality of life as a priority why didn't I get this awareness that my mom had 40 years before first of all I'm sorry that you didn't get it you are not alone part of my answer as to what happened since those radical transformative heady period of taking on all of this structural sexism including in medicine part of what happened is that there were victories that there were some real changes that came about that made some of the thinking of the women's health movement more mainstream right people started recognizing that gender-based violence and sexual discrimination they were social problems reproductive rights right roie Wade in 1973 childbirth practices changed a lot it was almost unheard of for a father to be in a delivery room when Our Bodies Ourselves started and they really pushed to change our expectations of experiencing child birth of what kind of support we needed to go through that experience and what kind of options we should have or where to give birth and who would help deliver patient consent and consumer rights those lengthy and sometimes really comical lists of side effects you know the informed consent packets that come with medication was a result of the pressure that our buddies ourselves and other women's health organizations put on the whole industry i mean women's health became a whole new specialty within professional medicine those were all victories that of course we celebrate them and we're grateful for them but over time they seem to have taken that radical edge off of the ideas and the demands all of which weren't met even though that's a long list a lot of the things that our bodies ourselves and women's health movement were pushing for haven't happened these demands that were really radical and grassroots they became professionalized which was in a way the goal but it also diffused the energy and like the sense of urgency and even the sense of badassery of being on the front lines of protesting and rallying and capturing all of that big secondwave energy of feminism in the 70s that's so tricky because ultimately you want these things to be part of mainstream medicine so that they can be accessible to everyone but then it sort of necessitates compromise right it diffuses everything mhm and who's in charge of them and how many other interests are involved that are going to need balancing when there is something so clear to fight against and there is such clear injustice it feels so obvious and when it starts to be like okay how do we implement this how do we change a giant structure a huge system it gets so much more nuanced and subtle and harder to push against and define mhm i'm nodding vigorously i asked Laura what she thought about my theory that there's these pushes forward and then loss of momentum in this awareness of medicine's shortfalls throughout our history first I'd say it's a fallacy to think of history as just linear progress we want it to be that but that's not how it has ever worked it's also seems cyclical at times i have a whole class lecture I'll spare you about waves and the wave theory i mean the idea of waves of feminism was first coined in 1968 so it has a lot to do about separating one generation from another but there is something to it in these cycles of activism and then backlash so if someone wanted to help raise awareness of how little medicine knows about women's bodies today what should one do i think what we need to do is push for education that's uphill right now sex education in general is very hotly debated at best right now that's one of those things that hasn't happened in the wake of the women's health movement school curricula themselves didn't really change most people don't learn about menstruation in school it's not in the textbooks i think defending free speech is really really important without free speech then we can't have these discussions and we can't advance what we know about things continuing to push back against the stigmas and the myths so that we can have open exchange of information and conversations cuz we are not there yet that consciousness raising is an idea that goes back to the 1970s but I think is still super relevant the idea of helping people become aware of the enormity of these issues and how they're not alone talking to Laura made me feel a little calmer about all of this somehow she's been doing this work and she's thrilled we're here now but she doesn't have that edge of desperation I feel like I have in my voice sometimes that oh God have you seen this we really have to do something she's like ""Welcome yes it is very bad out there would you like to come in and see what we've been working on for the last 50 years?"" Personally I would like a little music break and I'm in charge here so we're taking a little music break going to call it sick to work i don't care my dirt can't believe all the pain I need give me white wine and bike all my girls they want to go take their mind so it's got a letter on my baby too cuz I got sharks in hoppers surfing surfing the wave all the girls are surfing the wave surfing the crimson way today that was Crimson Wave by Taco Cat when we talk about the importance of free speech and sex ed I agree let's have slash keep those things but aside from calling up my reps once again I'm not sure what I can do to contribute to those fights i think my mom might have some insight as a genuine card carrying consciousness raising 70s feminist if we want to get back to that information sharing mutual support getting more information into the hands of people making the decisions what do you think we can do the obvious thing politically is to just be speaking out about it especially about abortion right now to be writing to your reps one thing that I think some Democrats are talking about doing is trying to bring up a national right to abortion law which they've talked about forever but even though they'll probably get voted down just do it do that kind of just ground level citizen work politically even though it's depressing it's a hard thing to accept that we've got this setback but I mean one thing I'm thinking of doing because Maine is fine as far as abortion law we even have a law that was just put in that protects doctors who are prescribing abortion pills for people in red states where abortion's illegal i'd like to find out how can I host women who are looking to get an abortion we've been making donations to groups that are providing funding for women who are looking to get abortions so there are those kinds of things that you can do especially to help other women who are in desperate situations on just that basic level of body awareness i mean I just think talking to each other more just more talking to your friends maybe forming a small group where you can get together and go back to those days of sharing a lot of information i mean my basic feeling is you do not put this genie back in the bottle it's not happening right i think for so many of us older women there is just this kind of sadness about wow are we really back here again does it feel at all annoying that I'm doing a thing that is basically trying to do the same thing that groups you were involved in were doing 50 years ago is that annoying to you no it's not annoying i mean eye rolling is a little strong but you know when you'll say like ""Oh my god there's just no information out there on women's health."" It's like uh oh my god what it made me think of is it doesn't matter what your parents believe how enlightened or unenlightened they might be they're still your parents and so you're still not totally going to listen to them well yeah it seems like something that you really have to come at from your own perspective yes absolutely after learning so much about my mom's experience in the 70s and the kind of awareness that she had about the medical system and our vulnerability within it I was really curious what my early experiences with death cramps were like for her so when I was 14 and had my first death cramps episode at school and had to get taken home from that and was throwing up and passed out and that was really scary for all of us and you took me I think this was my first gynecological appointment the way I remember it is we went to this person who to me she is a doctor because she had an office and I sat on a table with paper on it and she looked at my vagina and that's a doctor certified nurse midwife that's what she was okay yes what was it like from your perspective getting the call from the school nurse and then going to pick me up seeing me in that much pain oh my god Kate i'm going to start crying here it was horrible that's okay it was absolutely horrible i mean it's always horrible for a parent when your child whatever age they are is going through a lot of pain it was horrible i tried everything I could think of you know I gave you the hot pads the ibuprofen all of that stuff taking you to Joyce I felt like that was what I knew to do like let's see what she says i trusted her to give us some insight into what was going on joyce is the name of that certified nurse midwife she was my mom's midwife when she gave birth to my sister and my whole family was on a firstname basis with her unfortunately she is also the one who told me that some women just have painful periods and that it would all go away when I had my first baby people contain multitudes i also felt the way you did when she said that i felt like that is not helpful like she's in too much pain for you to be just saying ""Oh okay you just got to wait."" But she knew more than I did and because of what we were just talking about earlier I was very reluctant to take you to the mainstream medical establishment and have some OBGYn guys look at you and say ""Okay we need to get you on four different drugs."" So I really didn't know what to do so one thing I want to make sure to say is just to apologize to you that I didn't do more than I did oh I mean doing research in those days wasn't like googling you know you I would have had to go to a medical center but I should have I should have done it and I didn't and I feel badly about that no Mom you have nothing to apologize for at every step of the way you did your best you took care of me and Mave and there's no part of me that blames you for any of this that thinks this is your fault i don't think I would have had a better outcome if you had made different choices i really don't i think this is just kind of what happens it sucks but it's not your fault that it sucks so what do we know we know that western professional medicine for as long as it has existed has never really known much about female bodies though it is happy to prescribe medicine and take drastic measures on female bodies we know that there are pendulum swings throughout history there are moments when people are very aware of mainstream medicine's shortcomings and push against it and when that leads to some progress eventually the movement that pushed for that progress slows down fragments or moves on to other pressing issues some laws get passed mainstream medicine adopts some changes and even though the core problem hasn't changed it gets harder to muster up the support to push against it so are we in one of those moments right now where we're about to push back i don't know over the last 50 years things have sped up a lot maybe each generation has their own pendulum swings maybe instead of thinking about this as history repeating itself or as doing the same thing over and over again without it working maybe it's more like rocking a car out of a snowbank to use a metaphor appropriate for rural Maine you can't do it in one big push you have to push let the car roll back then push and get a little further then let the car roll back and eventually with enough people pushing together and enough momentum we can get the car out of the snow so to belabor the metaphor I hope you'll push with me next week we get into period pain representation in media if the biggest thing we can do to push things forward is share our experiences and information with as many people as possible why don't we see period pain in movies or TV or even social media i talked to experts to figure out why and how we can change it cramps is hosted and created by me Kate Helen Downey kelsey Donzo is our editorial producer sound design and mixing is by Kelly Chrome at Maven Post Media our associate producer is Caitlyn Sabader cramp's incredible theme song is written and performed by Faraday our podcast art was created by Nicholas Shepard this podcast is supported by the Simons Foundation's Science Society and Culture Initiative fiscal sponsorship for Cramp is provided by the Arkansas Podcast Collaborative special thanks to Mia Lobel Ivette Modau and Matthew Star if you want to join a community of real people talking about their period pain and sharing information email crampedodcast@gmail.com to get a link to our Discord and if you like me were intimidated by Discord don't be it's basically Slack if this podcast has been useful or helpful to you please give us a five-star rating on Apple Podcasts or Spotify and leave us a review we are an independent podcast and taking just a minute to rate and review it genuinely helps other people find us who might need this information"

eeuWErhHfLk,Sexual harassment at work and the strategies to fight it  FRANCE 24 English,2025-03-24T21:00:07Z,UCQfwfsi5VrQ8yKZ-UWmAEFg,gender violence,US,10,780,7,Why did it take French so long to charge himAnd why is this so rampant in France  Help me ,let's get more on this case joined by the journalist and essayist Natasha Henry Natasha is an expert on gender based violence and is also an international consultant for the Council of Europe Natasha thank you for being with us I'm wondering what you make of this case because we all have an image if we've been part of French culture for a number of years of J Deo as a younger actor with energy and vibrancy and now of course this is painted completely different image of of deio the man the actor yes what what is quite surp surprising I find is that when the uh producers of that film and the director and everybody else around that movie um hired him in 2021 he was already under investigation for rape um and so it was something that was already known that he had this bad behavior to say the least U towards women um towards women who are usually under um him in the uh hierarchy of Cinema so there's a real influence there that he's taking advantage of he's taking advantage of vulner vulnerable women I mean vulnerable because they don't have his status they're not at his level in the way of reputation and everything um which is what we find in French companies in French hospitals and you know everywhere in France you have people who think they can get away with this with the sexual harassment and everything because they are um assaulting women who are not in such a strong place so a pattern not just in cinema not just with departure but with alleged innocent proven guilty of course that that is all going through but it's a patent within Society men using their power and influence to exploit to take advantage of sexually women fortunately we have laws in this country and all this is no longer possible so I really encourage women who work for French companies or with French um in a French situation or or French Cinema um to um tell everybody everybody what's about what's happening because some people will believe them and there's also a very interesting point is Witnesses a witness doesn't need doesn't need according to the French law to have seen the thing happening a witness can be somebody you have talked to after it's happened and this person will be a witness and in that kind of situation it's very very important and it will be brought to the case so that breaks down depar lawyer argument about there were no witnesses witnesses who saw what happened because were clearly the people who uh suffered or the women who suffered at his hands they spoke about it but you say there were others who saw it as well they were Witnesses um they both went to see doctors who um gave them sick leave for about a week both of them so that's pretty impressive in your um legal file um so yeah talk to everybody and also there is a law in France that also says that you cannot be prosecuted for having helped a victim or having being spoken up because maybe the victim is too embarrassed too shy too frightened too scared too weak too vulnerable to say anything but please everybody else around do something and nothing can happen to you in the workplace they can't fire you or or hold it against you if you speak in favor of a victim it's very difficult isn't it though for for a woman to actually stand up and say something very difficult uh it's still this stigma which goes with it uh of perhaps being blamed which is completely unjustified of course and also this fear that in spite of what you said about laws you will still somat become the victim if you speak out yes I go to companies and I talk about the prevention of sexual harassment um one thing that people don't know yet in this country is that the law now includes um stupid jokes for instance all the sexual jokes and sexist jokes that used to be funny for them uh are now considered as sexual harassment it's taken very seriously now in this country um of course there's always somebody who will say ah she was looking for it she but in the case of Gerardo I don't I don't know how you could be on his side I mean he's got a whole list of behavior like this this whole argument of a woman dressing in such a way which says she's looking for it I mean it's it's such an abhorrent thing to say because everybody should have the freedom to dress to feel to act and be how they are how they feel they are and not be a threat from somebody's predatory behavior also it's not true because they do that no matter what you're wearing yeah so so it's not because of your minis skirt that somebody will in the workplace maybe on the street is could be different but it's about power isn't it it's about having that power over someone it's about expressing that power it's so cruel to do this because the woman goes to work on the film set or anywhere else and and she wants to have a normal day at work and get paid for it but she has to avoid change her her daily routine park the car somewhere else avoid this elevator avoid this office avoid this Corridor it's very very time consuming and energy consuming so I'm very glad that Gerardo paru is serving um all of us he's helping all of us to speak up and and he is one big example of what's going on my own my own daughter opened my eyes to the things that she has to do to make sure that she feels safe she she lives mainly in in London and the things that you're talking about it really resonates with what my daughter has told me and it's it's horrible and really you know Society has to change Natasha thank you for coming in and sharing your thoughts and Analysis with

dressed as soldiers  Western and Arab countries and Pakistani Generals permanently lost moral ground to talk about humanity will never be forgotten  This is what the chosen specialise in  If Israelis dont want to be accused of being like the Nazis they simply need to stop behaving like Nazis Norman Finkelstein  History will judge not only the oppressors but those who remained silent   This is Evil beyond the Belief and get across every limit   Sent to my most moral state reps who have never condemned Israeli atrocities or felt  grief for the death of a single Palestinian child  In their minds theyre gods that can never be held accountable for their evil deeds Sick society with no empathy kindness or compassion in their system  Shouldnt the IDF be declared a terrorist organization,a Chillin new UN report titled more than a human can bear highlights how Israel systematically used sexual reproductive and other forms of gender-based violence since the 7th of October 2023 it is the first in-depth un investigation into sexual reproductive and other forms of gender-based Violence by the Israeli security forces and Israeli settlers since October 2023 as part of a broader effort to undermine their right to self-determination it also concludes that Israel has carried out genocidal acts through the systematic destruction of sexual and reproductive Health Care Facilities according to the UN these crimes have been targeted both men and women children and the elderly differently in order to quote dominate oppress and destroy the Palestinian people the frequency prevalence and severity of sexual and gender-based crimes perpetrated across the occupied Palestinian territory leads the commission to conclude that sexual and gender-based violence is increasingly used as a method of War by Israel to destabilize dominate oppress and destroy the Palestinian people the commission documented a pattern of sexual violence including cases of rape and other forms of sexual violence torture and other inhumane acts then amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity the report found that women have been disproportionately impacted some have been stripped in front of their family members and others sexually assaulted in detention centers Israeli male soldiers exposing their genitals at checkpoints I I haven't heard of this before um how how common is it is it particular checkpoints where this is occurring does it seem to be focused specifically on women or yes it is prevalent in certain checkpoints in Hein so I went on a field visit the other day and we had to sneak in because we're not allowed into the H2 area and I had to talk to women and she said that there's a certain checkpoint if you go through that checkpoint you're more like to be to see genitors that day and so and I um verified that with other women that day on the same field visit have one testimony of a woman who was heading to University and when she got to the checkpoint and because of the structure of the checkpoint it's closed so nobody sees what goes on in there so if you get into the checkpoint nobody sees because it's it has I I can show you pictures but it's closed so it's not exposed to the public so when she got in there she said the soldier stood in a corner in which the cameras wouldn't videotape him he knew which blind spot for the camera and then he exposed his genitals and he said come take a look come touch it in Arabic um this is one of the cases we documented but also I've talked to the women and they said yes there's an Infamous checkpoint in heon in which the soldier does that to women and girls who go through this checkpoint and they started avoiding going to that certain checkpoints we have similar cases in Jerusalem against school girls but this school girl was molested and she was touched by the Israeli soldiers at the checkpoint and she's 14 years old she was getting to the school and they pretended to be searching her they took her backpack they threw everything on the ground they started touching her touching her breasts touching her inappropriately and she said I felt like I was this was not a proper search that we usually and where's a female Soldier to search me and this girls their fight to go to school anymore so depends on the situation but I would say yes there are Infamous checkpoints is reallying newspaper hatet reported in August 20124 that one resident said that the harassment became a routine and that Israeli forces said quote nasty words to her woman stated that they were afraid to go to the checkpoint alone the violence isn't limited to women Palestinian boys and men have also been subjected to sexual abuse filmed and photographed as a form of [Music] humiliation for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and we reported earlier in June 2024 are Israeli soldiers torturing Palestinians to death by putting metal rots up their anuses this is SED men an Israeli military in southern Israel that based on Survival testimonies has been acting as a torture and interrogation Camp the commission has not received any information about prosecutions of members of the Israeli security forces or Israeli settlers for sexual and violence committed since October 2023

Um this is one of the cases we documented but also I've talked to the women and they said yes there's an infamous checkpoint in Hebrin in which the soldier does that to women and girls who go through this checkpoint and they started avoiding going to that certain checkpoints We have similar cases in Jerusalem against school girls But this school girl was molested and she was touched by the Israeli soldiers at the checkpoint and she's 14 years old She was getting to the school and they pretended to be searching her They took her backpack They threw everything on the ground And they started touching her touching her breasts touching her inappropriately And she said I felt like I was this was not a proper search that we usually and where's a female soldier to search me And this girl terified to go to school We will resume the hearing of the commission of inquiry and welcome our next participants Would you like to introduce yourselves first and um then I'll invite you to make an opening statement and I can ask you some questions arising from your statement after that My name is Kaya and I work for the women's center for legal aid and counseling I work on um documentation of Israeli occupations violation against Palestinian women in the West Bank and Jerusalem Um is that enough for Okay thank you Hi thank you for having us here today Um I am also an international um advocate for Palestine I work for a Palestinian-based organization We work um domestically on making sure women and youth are included in decision-making processes Internationally we um share the Palestinian narrative through a gendered perspective So focusing on how women and youth are um uniquely impacted by the Israeli occupation and Israeli violations Thank you very much Thank you very much Would you like to start um like I said I work on the documentation of violations against Palestinian women and girls in the West Bank and Jerusalem Um I go basically to the field and I get to document and interview women who have been victims of um international humanitarian law violations For the past year and a half we have been heavily documenting sexual violence against Palestinian women and girls in these areas And I want to lead by saying why it's really difficult for us to collect testimonies and maybe that we don't have as much data as we believe we should have because of the uh impact and because of the scale of violence and sexual violence that we have documented Uh basically starting with the unique social stigma that we have in Palestine which I believe the Israeli forces know of that and they use it and they exploit it And this is because even the terminology they use to uh violate and threaten with sexual violence and rape two men and women indicates their deep knowledge of the social stigma And I like to read with a story of the Halo family which happened in July 2023 It's when Israeli forces invaded the home of this family and they asked women under the threats of large dogs to undress It was female soldiers and they made the women walk around the house naked One organization reported that and they published that in a newspaper and then the um implication of that was quite catastrophic on the human rights because we had an interview on a radio with one of the tribe leaders of Hebrin which is a prominent figure of the hein society and the thing he said was this was a scandal and this human rights organization shouldn't have exposed these women in such matter This is one of the reasons women don't talk and it's only it's also because they know that this would deny them from being able to move around Their families would deny them to get to the university to get to the schools to get to their public daily life if they know that they are likely to get sexually violated at a checkpoint which we have been heavily documenting One of the things that makes also men and women afraid to talk is the fear of reprisals and fear of retaliation by Israeli officers We have been documenting um tactics that have been used heavily to threaten these women We have uh seen phone calls by prominent captains in the Israeli army calling these women on their phones asking them not to share any information and saying things such as I saw you at an interview yesterday If you do this again you're getting detained again And we have also documented cases in which women were red detained after sharing their testimonies with us One of the tactics also is being summoned for interviews Um they call a woman and they're like ""Come over We need to talk to you."" And they use that to intimidate these women Most of the women who were released following their last deal were threatened not to share any information about their what happened in there to human rights organizations or to journalists So it's been impossible to document all of that One of the things also that I think makes it difficult for women to identify sexual violence is the lack of knowledge and lack of terminology So we have women telling us that we had inspection devices inserted inside of us without being able to identify that as rape or sexual violence It's mainly because the Jordanian penal code applied in Palestine identifies rape as only being done by a man through his body So it doesn't even they don't even consider that they have been violated sexually or they don't talk about it as rape Uh we have been able to document sexual violence in detention centers Rape uh was mainly done by Israeli female officers inserting objects inside genitals We have also been able to document a case of rape gang rape by two soldiers twice two different soldiers twice on a woman from Gaza in a detention center and she said she was filmed during this process We have also been able to document sexual violence at checkpoints in Hebrin in the H2 area We have famous checkpoints now that women know that if you go through this checkpoint you're more likely to see genitals of Israeli soldiers at this certain checkpoint making women afraid to even go to work or to even get to schools At this point uh we have also been able to document sexual violence while home invasions nude searches with the intention to humiliate and with the intention of uh breaking the person making them get naked in front of family members and do uh humiliating poses for the Israeli soldiers to see and film At this point um this is what I'd like to start with and thank you for having us today So in the first year of the genocide on the Khaza strip by Israel our field workers all over the West Bank and the Khaza strip have been collecting testimonies from released female prisoners Um and what these testimonies reveal was a systematic trend of sexual violence that was being used as a weapon of genocide And what's clear is that although these women came from different geographical areas they were taken to different detention centers Um the tactics of sexual violence that were used by the Israeli military were all the same So it's very clear that it's um happening as a matter of policy and there's an directive for the to the Israeli military to engage in these methods of torture And we see that sexual violence happens at the checkpoint during home raids It happens in Israeli detention centers and it happens um in Israeli prisons Uh I'd like to highlight four themes that is prevalent um within all the testimonies that we collected and it's sort of the the manifestations of sexual violence and their effects Um so first is sexual violence is used as a means to exert control not only of the female victim but of her entire family especially the male members in her family Um for example during home raids um when a woman is being detained uh the male members in her family are uh taken to a separate room handcuffed blindfolded Um and in some testimonies that we've collected the female victim that is being arrested the the Israeli military will will touch her inappropriately in front of her male family members They'll make um sexual noises and gestures threaten to rape her even um and doing this in front of them while they're being handcuffed or blindfolded not a not able to stop it not able to protect the the it could be her daughter daughter sister um whatever it may be It's a it's a form to not only control the woman but also control the men as well and break up the family and in turn break up society as a whole when um through these instances The second theme is um sexual violence is used as a tool to threaten the woman's honor and to shame her um and using basically Palestinian concepts of shame and honor against the Palestinian woman Um you know making her fear that she'll be socially stigmatized um and be socially isolated um if you know sexual violence happens onto her to to fear her and to instill fear into her and make her comply Um the third theme is um we also see a widespread use of digital sexualbased violence and blackmail So this can happen through photographing a woman in a compromising position Um she could be nude have her veil her hijab removed Um photographing her in humiliating ways and then threatening to use those photos against her And then the fourth theme I want to highlight is um you know overall sexual violence in all these instances First and foremost it's being used as a means of humiliation and degradation Um and that is clear uh all across the board And sexual violence um you know our testimonies were compiled after October 7th but sexual violence is something that's been happening historically against all Palestinians by Israel since the very founding of Israel It is well known that in 1948 during the ethnic cleansing of Palestine um Israeli militia groups engaged in the rape of Palestinian women as a means to ethnically cleanse Palestinians Um and in the decades since sexual violence was al always used against Palestinian activists as a way to um get them to self-censor and not to be outspoken Um before I end I would just like to state how we define sexual violence So sexual violence can mean the forcible penetration uh either by a foreign object or the body part of another person It could be forced nudity inappropriate touching beatings of the genitalia It can also include acts which do not involve physical contact such as photographing and compromising positions and or while naked shaming and threats of rape In all the cases we've documented it's been violence that is humiliating or degra degradating in sexual nature In the past the UN has defined sexual violence in conflict areas as a form of political violence that not only mames individuals but also is used to intimidate entire populations Um and I think I'll I'll end with that and we're open to any questions Thank you both very much for your opening statements Um I'd like to go back to a number of the the matters that you raised and just received further comments from you on them Um let's start first with some of the challenges in documenting sexual and gender based violence Um you've both referred to that Um could you say perhaps a little bit more uh about how your organizations have approached this issue how it's been possible to encourage women to give evidence what can be done to give them comfort I guess um to provide them with protection so that they are confident to be able to give their testimonies because of the support of your organizations or others I can lead by saying even though it's impossible So we try like lots of tactics So what I try to do is to get women who know these women to give them comfort So we get a key person to contact them who they're comfortable with and to assure them anonymity We have to give them so many asurances that this will be anonymous They will not be their names will not be published uh the only woman who agreed to speak about her rape experience with her name mentioned It's quite peculiar because she had a let's say a unique social status compared to other women So some women were single so they were hoping to get married one day so they would not share their testimonies of sexual violence Some women were married they were afraid of their husbands or their husband's family because it has lots of social stigma and implications as well So they're afraid they would lose that But this woman she didn't care And I think she said because she was divorced she didn't care And I know it's quite weird like because of the social structure in the Palestinian society she didn't care She felt like she had nothing to lose at this point But which what we try to do is to give them anonymity And the difficulty when it comes to social stigma is a research has been done with interviewing over 30 detainees Not by us also They said that 70% of women who were detained never fully regained their social relationships because people say they might have been sexually assaulted in there So you can imagine how difficult it is Um this is what we do to give them um comfort to speak about all of this You but even though with all we get many women who refuse to tell us or to talk even with while being anonymous with with assurances to be anonymous at this point Um I'll also add on and and say that in the testimonies we collected we did so with the through the work of our field workers who are known in the communities that they live in Um so that helps uh that they're trusted and known members of the community But also despite that um women are still very very hesitant to speak out and afraid of retaliation Uh they know that the perpetrators will get away with what they did So they say ""What's the point in even reliving this trauma and retelling it when they know nothing is going to come of it?"" They not only that but they can also face retaliation by the Israeli army The Israeli army always threatens women and to to scare them from speaking out Um I'll say in our documentation we had um a woman a case of rape by an Israeli soldier Our field worker collected this testimony and shared it with us with our team And um it's complete u anonymous no names no locations was stated just the testimony itself A couple days later the woman contacted the field worker and she said ""I want my testimony erased I don't want anyone to know what happened to me."" Um it was a very traumatic story for her and she was afraid that some way somehow her family would find out She didn't want them to know and also the Israeli military would find out that she spoke out about it So we had to um we can't share the details of her testimony You mentioned amongst the examples You mentioned amongst the examples of of women's experience um Israeli male soldiers exposing their genitals at checkpoints I I haven't heard of this before Um how how common is it is it particular checkpoints where this is occurring does it seem to be focused specifically on women or this this one's new i'm sorry I I thought you you mentioned it Okay Yes it is prevalent in certain checkpoints in Hebrin So yeah I'm not sure if you're familiar with the situation and how many checkpoints are in the H2 area Indeed I've been to Hebrron on I've been to Hebrron on several occasions so I'm quite familiar with the nature of the place So I went on a field visit the other day and we had to sneak in because we're not allowed into the H2 area And I had to talk to women and she said that there's a certain checkpoint If you go through that checkpoint you're more likely to be to see genitals that day And so and I um verified that with other women that day in the same field visit And I asked she's like ""It didn't happen to me but I know people who it happened to them."" So they know women but we have one testimony of a woman who was heading to university and when she got to the checkpoint and because of the structure of the checkpoint it's closed So nobody sees what goes on in there So if you get into the checkpoint nobody sees because it's it has I can show you pictures but it's closed So it's not exposed to the public So when she got in there she said the soldier stood in a corner in which the cameras wouldn't videotape him He knew which blind spot for the camera And then he exposed his genitals and he said ""Come take a look Come touch it in Arabic Um this is one of the cases we documented but also I've talked to the women and they said yes there's an infamous checkpoint in Hebrin in which the soldier does that to women and girls who go through this checkpoint and they started avoiding going to that certain checkpoints We had similar cases in Jerusalem against school girls but this school girl was molested and she was touched by the Israeli soldiers at the checkpoint and she's 14 years old She was getting to the school and they pretended to be searching her They took her backpack They threw everything on the ground They started touching her touching her breasts touching her inappropriately And she said ""I felt like I was this was not a proper search that we usually Where's a female soldier to search me?"" And this girl is terrified to go to school anymore So depends on the situation but I would say yes there are infamous checkpoints Just going back for a moment to the the one you mentioned in Hebrron Uh over what period of time do you have you received these reports is this long-standing or a specific period they said there an appointed new soldier after October 7th because they have changed a lot of positions Yeah Okay Thank you And the since we're on checkpoints uh other findings you've made about conduct or misconduct by soldiers at checkpoints can you tell us a bit more about that we haven't been able to document many cases because people go through checkpoints every day and like I said these women are afraid if someone knows about this testimony their families wouldn't let them commute anymore because we have documented that as well uh in these areas which which there are checkpoints women are less likely to get an education and women are less like more likely to get married early because their families would want to send them out of this area But the testimony that we have collected is one testimony from the woman I told you about and what women told us in the area about that and they said they can't give me names at this point but they know that of that certain checkpoints It's also okay Yeah Yeah We have uh testimonies of women who were taken at checkpoints both in the West Bank and the Kaza strip I'll talk first of the West Bank um women who are just passing through not suspecting anything and then they're pulled over and arrested in very violent ways Um we have testimonies of women who at the checkpoint having their out outer clothing removed if they were hijab having their hijab removed in public in front of others Um we have a testimony of a woman who was uh electrocuted with a or tased um at the checkpoint Um so these are things that happened in the West Bank in Kaza We have countless testimonies of women who were fleeing south through the Nazarim corridor Is that how you pronounce it the safety corridor to go south Um and they were taken at that checkpoint um by Israeli soldiers abducted in broad daylight separated from their children and just forcibly disappeared And they um I could speak more about the conditions they were taken to but uh that is something that was also happening in Kaza I need to add something um in regards to checkpoints in Gaza as well It's like the same thing when it comes to evacuating from the north to the south Women have testified that because the soldiers know that they have jewelry and they have it on their bodies they have used that as an excuse to both loot them and molest them So we have testimonies of that three testimonies of women being looted because they know that women are more likely to carry the jewelry and the expensive stuff and they would drop them and make them fully undressed and touch them touch their bras and molest them in the way to get the jewelry and the expensive stuff out of their undergarments has been able to keep field workers operating in Gaza over the last year and a half So our office in the Gaza Strip was bombed very early on in the genocide However our field workers have continued their work and I mean I don't know how but thankfully they've continued supplying us with very very important testimonies and documentation and conditions on the ground that we're trying to spread as much as we can Yeah similarly we don't have an office but we have field researchers who continue their work Uh they had their houses bombed so they had to evacuate So they had more testimonies at the schools they were taken refuge in and they have managed to collect the testimonies all the time as well Well yeah So a large store of information and documentation right and have you done anything with that in terms of promoting or trying to find accountability from the Israeli authorities uh we have been thinking about starting litigation in this manner but with the new bills that might be enacted soon like the ICJ laws in Israel now and punishing people who work on it and they can get to prison as well So we're trying to cautiously navigate this but on the other like mechanisms we have never been able to get any accountability whatsoever So we know of that So we haven't even tackled that at this point What we try to do is advocacy and like giving these testimonies to special procedures and try to talk about it as much as we can but in terms of accountability as my organization we haven't it's quite scary at this point because we can get our funding taken away we can get our offices closed so yeah that's uh accountability is unfortunately very difficult to achieve I mean us as an organization we just share our reporting and advocate as much as we can and share it with the relevant um like international fora but I think accountability needs to come from the international community especially countries that are still supplying Israel with arms political support economic support still engaging with them um you know even despite the ICJ advisory opinion and the ICC case and you know all the calls of of genocide um Israel still being supported by so many countries so I think that's where accountability needs to come Do you know of any situation where one or more women have reported to the Israeli authorities uh acts of violence what has happened to those reports whether they've been investigated no Um I don't know specific cases but it is known in general that um being tried in Israeli military court it uh you know Israeli soldiers are never held accountable the conviction rate is is 0% It's futile Can we focus on Gaza um both of you have have mentioned the sexual violence that has been reported in Gaza Can you say a bit more about that the the the nature of the violence where it occurs the circumstances that make it possible So we have documented that I would say in detention centers women who were taken from and they were taken to Sedan We have one woman because it's infamous for having sexual violence in it and it's for men So this woman says she was taken to Sedet Man and she was nude searched over and over again and filmed and then she was raped twice by Israeli male soldiers two of them at a time while videotaping her We have also one testimony of a woman who was also taken This is in addition to the threats of rape and like the nude searches all the time with the intention to humiliate and to degrade these women She was also she says she was also raped by an inspection device by a female soldier more than once Um they inserted the inspection device in her rectum We have also one testimony of a woman saying that she was trip searched and they would beat her on her behind and they would humiliate her in front of each other Uh this is for detention centers This is the most I'm saying the most outrageous testimonies but we have lesser details of humiliation and sexual violence over and over again but this is the most severe ones Also when it comes to checkpoints like I said it's it's where the sexual violence happens and it goes unreported So we have a testimony of a a teenage girl who was made to undress a man in front because he refused to undress They made him they made her undress him even though she's not related to him She doesn't know who that man is and while being searched and touched and molested on their breast and and their on their genitals as well Most of the women also who were taken from West Bank and Jerusalem said they were beaten on their genitals which is which has made it you to conclude that there must have been a directive that's been given to the Israeli army to treat women in such manner because in Jerusalem you're treated by completely different law enforcement than in or in the Westbank but all these women said they were beaten or the genitals uh this is for us that this is what we could collect Um but we're waiting for the women that were released recently to get more testimonies on this [Music] And I could just add on uh about the women who were forcibly disappeared in Kaza Like I said before it was usually as they were fleeing south through the safety corridor they were abducted at the checkpoint Um many were taken to the Zakim detention center and the negative detention center and I'm probably saying those wrong Um but at the northern border of the Khaza strip and it is known and this is confirmed in our testimonies as well that both men and women are um put uh all together in one large hall forced to strip completely naked and just sit in this hall the woman with the amongst each other and the men amongst each other And it's also been reported and known that um Israeli civilians are invited to come to this detention center and mock the Palestinian prisoners while they're naked photograph them um and watch them as if it's a a zoo Uh so that's something that we've seen Other than that there was um just widespread use of force strip search uh inappropriate touching and groping of the body um sexual gestures and sounds and uh threats of rape also using um you know the women who were fleeing with their children um threatening to kill her children uh if she didn't comply with them if she didn't force if she didn't remove her clothes they threatened to kill her children Um and all these women were taken from detention center to detention center to detention center They had no idea where they were where they were going how long they would be there given no information just kind of taken from one place to the next and throughout that throughout the entire process being continually strip searched and touched and um sexually assaulted The um girls a couple of times are you seeing any different treatment for girls under 18 from um adult women are they treated the same without distinguishing age or I mean how how are girls treated by them i think the thing that I would say is um girls are shamed more than older women are um in terms of uh we mentioned this earlier um being told that they're bringing shame to their family They're bringing problems to their father's head They'll never get married um they should just focus on you know getting married and having children and living a simple life So being dissuaded from um I wouldn't even use the word activism because all a lot of these women they're just posting on their social medias maybe showing solidarity with what's happening in Kaza and that was um kind of the reason for arrest and the reason during interrogation Israeli soldiers are are warning them and um threatening them with those posts We see more of that towards we see that um towards younger women more the documentation we have is for two girls minors in Jerusalem Uh we have three testimonies One girl was sexually assaulted by settlers and and in most cases even like uh the soldiers would see that and the police would see that they wouldn't do anything So she was groped and touched by settlers We have two testimonies Women were girls were touched by Israeli soldiers by heading to while heading to schools They were like I said touched on their breasts and on their genitals while pretending to be searching them This is the testimonies But when it comes to detention centers they put women with girls together so they don't separate them We have a testimony of a woman who had her a girl who had her first period in prison So they put them together They don't separate them They don't treat them differently or better Is that if that's what you're asking so yeah they should be treated better under all circumstances with children in detention Um the prison that you're referring to in the last situation was that in Israel or West Bank was it military or civil sorry the you talked about the the the women the the girls who were placed in prisons at the same same prisons No it's in it's in Hifa It's in Hifa Okay So it's up north U are there within Israel specialized facilities for girls or are they always detained with women i don't think they treat them they put them together like girls and women together That's to the best of my knowledge on this Um however there are many women who before they were transferred to Demon Women's Prison they were taken to detention centers that had both men and women and they had criminals uh both Israeli and and Palestinian So there are many cases where women were um taken to cells that had men in them um with no protection Uh and also they would in these while they were in these cells at this detention center they would be repeatedly repeatedly shamed in Arabic by the men that were around them Um and you know we have um one young woman who who spoke of this that this happened to her and then when she was transferred she just thought it was a coincidence that she had this horrible man with her in the prison at the same time that was  shaming her but then when she was transferred to Ed Deon and she told the other woman there of her experience they said yeah that happened to us too So it was very clear that it's happened it happens as a intentionally as a method to psychologically break down the prisoner the female prisoner Have you had reports of girls being detained in Gaza or or just women in Gaza since the 7 October we only documented with women in but like the women told us that they were taken with girls as well but we haven't interviewed girls and at this point Yeah us as well It's just the woman Can we hear from you about the impact of sexual violence on the victims and what what what the longerterm consequences are for them uh I can start with that because in areas like Huburn like I said we have reported women told us that they married their girls at 16 and 17 because they wanted them out of this area that they have to commute through checkpoints all the time Similarly for areas for girls in area C in which they get assaulted by settlers and they get these sexual slurs at them all the time So they would rather send their girls out of these areas by marrying them to someone who lives outside of the affected place Also women not being able to commute to their schools and to their jobs because of that because their families wouldn't let them like they would rather not have an education than have our daughter sexually assaulted at some checkpoint This is what we have got on this Uh this is in addition to women losing their livelihoods and not being able to get there In addition to social shaming and because of we have this case of this soldier who keeps harassing this woman particular woman and by sexually saying sexual insults um the whole community started talking about her in a way that she's you had to get her husband divorced her because of the talking and all of that So it's a social impact that was she couldn't deal with In addition to that this is in addition to the psychological harm and the way that you see it on these women and you see it in their eyes when they talk and and how much they hesitate and how much they're traumatized and they would never like want to go through that experience ever again and that's why we make sure they stay anonymous [Music] just to speak of a woman who faced sexual violence"
"um from Gaza It's very clear from their testimonies the amount of psychological and emotional turmo turmoil that they're facing because not only did they face these horrible violations these sexual violations while they were forcibly abducted but also they were when they were returned to Gaza what are they returning to they're returning to genocide They're dealing with starvation Their homes were demolished They're displaced Members of their family were killed So the trauma from the sexual violence it it becomes secondary but it's still persistent there Their first thing you know it's a need of survival number one and so all this together it's just um creates a very very horrible emotional state for these women who at the moment have no support and what do you see as the impact on the Palestinian community generally it's kind I think I I understand sometimes the stigma it's it's horrible I know but sometimes I think it stems from the fact that men feel emasculated in a way that they could not protect the women or the girls from all of that and it the way it leads them to I don't want to hear about it also with the thing is like we have this I have two testimonies of women because I include like the social impact of the violation what did you feel like happened socially so one woman said that her husband took her to a gynecologist ologist to make sure she was not sexually assaulted in a way We have a testimony also of a woman who was really happy that her husband didn't ask her if if she was sexually assaulted because it means that he doesn't think her owner was compromised And I think this also we have also documented domestic violence arising in areas in which there are these checkpoints Um I know it's causation correlation maybe we can talk about this but we have um been able to detect that especially prisoners who get sexually assaulted and the way it impacts their whole family The family itself starts to suppress this person stopping them from talking We had a woman who shared her testimony with us and then we published something about it online with their consent of course and then we had her family contacting us telling us to take it down We don't want this to be known about our daughter So I think it affects the whole family It also endorses this culture because they're aware of it and the terminology like I said they use indicates their deep knowledge of how much this subject is important They endorse it They make sure they exploit it to the fully to the extent that they can and they also I visited the prison and I met with men who were also threatened with the rape of their daughters that it's I I don't know how it impacts the whole society as a whole like I can't do this social research and work on it but I can tell you it's it's getting a lot of anger because it's a large scale and people are getting so radicalized because of this more women are talking now more so than before because of the large scale like I said lots of women are have been have gone through that We had one journalist going on the media saying that this happened to her the uh threats of rape uh the nude searching So women are talking and it's getting people more angry more radicalized In my opinion it's very clear that uh the Israeli military is enacting sexual violence on Palestinian men and women as a means um as an attempt to break up the society as a whole you know when they parade men in their underwear in the streets of Khaza shackled on the hands and feet when they post photos of the lingerie of women online Um you know these are acts that are um trying to humiliate the man to emasculate the man and shame the woman and um in turn just break up try to break up the whole society Has it been successful i don't think so Um you know Palestinian prisoners uh have a lot of support from Palestinian society Um however it's um you know it's a these are violations that are happening repeatedly They they're happening in the West Bank They're happening in they have been for decades East Jerusalem Yeah Thank you It's a dark bit East Jerusalem Sorry Uh it's been really difficult to collect testimonies from East Jerusalem Like it's the most difficult one of all areas Women wouldn't talk They're afraid because of the laws the new laws even they would distribute out of your residency out of your per out of anything you have to stay in Jerusalem So women are afraid um it's really impossible So we get women we give them assurances of anonymity No one is going to know about this They wouldn't talk But in the West Bank and it's way easier for these women to talk while talking to them in Jerusalem any I need to spend a lot of time to get to get any data on this because they're terrified We have cases of which two women detainees were um exiled out of Jerusalem and now they're sent to the West Bank So people are afraid Yeah Do either of your organizations collect information about um these kinds of activities in Israel proper across the green line no Right I just um yeah just wonder what the experience of Palestinian citizens of Israel may be in comparison with say East Jerusalem West Bank Gaza I have a testimony of a woman in Jerusalem which is not East Jerusalem Um it's the she was wearing green and then she went to work at a daycare that was following October 7th and then she had a female soldier asking her why you were why are you wearing green today and she the girl said it's none of your business and she detained her for that fully stripped her kept beating her in her genitals like back and forth and she would beat her and humiliate her for 4 hours she said the cameras were recording the whole time and then she sent her then they were like oh you can go and that's it and um and and this woman was so terrified of talking we had to give her assurances and for us for her to give her test her testimony and she said that she knows someone else but we tried to contact her she wouldn't nudge she wouldn't talk they're afraid to go back and go through the same experience because in Jerusalem they have so much more to lose than in the West Bank they have residencies they have home demolitions as punitive measures so even if it's you you get away with it your family is going to go through a lot if they apply for any permits to build anything And we also have been documenting home demolitions as punitive measures against families in Jerusalem as well In addition to revoking of residencies and many people wouldn't talk because they're afraid they wouldn't be unified with their families if they have any applications which is we have staff in our organization as well afraid for that That's why we're really hesitant to move around with the litigation because they have applied for family unifications and they're afraid it would it would be rejected if they know that we're working on this at this point Do you have any information about the golem golem No that seems to be a bit of a a a black hole in terms of human rights information generally So okay thank you for that part Um my last question is just what is the most effective way of dealing with these issues we publish reports Um we urge accountability but um we need to actually correct the situation improve the situation on the ground From your organizational experiences what is the best way to make a difference no Well for for your organizations first let's let us learn from your strategies and successes I think um It's it's more we shouldn't just urge for accountability We must demand it You know it's horrible that an entire genocide took place in the Gaza Strip and no one was able to stop it there Like I said earlier countries are still supplying arms and economic and political support Um so demanding the complete arms embargo against Israel Um acting within the the um advisory meas measures that were laid out in the ICJ advisory opinion um and just um you know demanding accountability on a state level from each state who is complicit in the continued occupation of Palestine and um I think now what's really effective is organizations that are enacting in litigation against companies and countries that are complicit in the occupation Um so hopefully if there could be more momentum on that front it might see an effect on the ground Have you been have you been denied access to come visit the OBT of course I mean like how can a a state refuse to work and collaborate with the UN and at the same time still have a seat that that's to me what we try to call for at this point because you can't pick and choose what you want when you want to have a voice or not at this point and denial of like all of the special procedures to come and visit Palestine We have had a meeting with Braila Patton who came and visited and we hosted her in our offices at the time and we got the organizations to come and share their testimonies and even though we had a really tiny window of time uh we tried to collect as much as we can but we couldn't find women within a day or two to get them to talk about their sexual uh torture experiences in Israeli prisons and for that the report that she published was quite dismissive in a way um and it made people lose faith in us as an organization let's say lose trust trust um it affected us so I think negatively in a way because even women now don't talk to us anymore not as an organization but any organization that works in human rights people are losing faith in the system they don't want to give testimonies anymore they think it's futile um and I know I know for your mandate publishing reports and um calling it what it is and saying the facts the way they are helps and goes a long way for that um and I think we start tackling the issue of denial of access to all of the the commission of inquiry and the special reperators to the Palestine to Palestine in general Well for us from the beginning there's been a significant legal issue there that the the state of Israel we acknowledge has the right to refuse access to anybody It shouldn't as a member of the United Nations but it has no right to refuse us access to the occupied Palestinian territory um no right under international law at all to prevent a UN mechanism from going into Palestine So this is a a constant concern of ours that is legal and not merely political Um I'm sorry I do have one more question before we finish and that's the impact um on protecting women in Gaza West Bank East Jerusalem um of Western aid cuts Um the United States abandonment of international assistance is is has received the most um attention but we are seeing increasingly in European countries um aid being cut What have you seen yet impacts on women in Palestine of the Western aid cuts or if you've not seen them yet what do you anticipate seeing we have been able to document violence against women because they are less likely to get the aid and even even if they get in lines it's physical quite physical in some cases they're more less likely to get the aid that they need uh we have been also documenting following the cut of AIDS even in the first period before the ceasefire how women had more UTI because they couldn't have access to anything any sanitary bats anything that could have been provided to them by the aid and we're anticipating lots of violence in this case and we have also been anticipating human trafficking against women and girls in I know it's maybe you would say it's less likely but we have seen even publications on social media saying that in Egypt that now we get Palestinian women and girls in here and they're cheaper to marry in some and this is has made us really scared u of having a rise in that as well but mostly we have been able to document domestic violence rise due to that and it's also important to note that it's not just the cutting of funding for international aid but it's the deliberate blocking of that aid by Israel at the borders which is happening until today even after ceasefire humanitarian aid is still being blocked and like My colleagues said it does um impact women Um they're more vulnerable to these uh to aid blocking especially women who are pregnant breastfeeding women who um need sanitary materials hygiene materials They can be more susceptible and more vulnerable to disease Um yeah something's quite like the social impact It can be sometimes unique in a way you wouldn't even be able to detect it So we have women who have lost family members all family members and they had to evacuate to schools for example and we have been able to document how men of that school would start to act like the guardians like where are you going were you late and we have documented so so many layers of that like things you wouldn't even think of of how that impacted women who have lost all of their family members and they had to live with other family members like the uncles or far family relatives and how they made them do lots of labor and then the woman would feel like okay they're giving me refuge they're giving me food so I might as well just comply and do all of that and we're anticipating more of this catastrophe to be honest if this hasn't doesn't stop Yeah Well thank you both Um anything we haven't covered anything you'd like to add before we finish um I haven't mentioned this testimony but I think I owe it to her to say something This woman was taken with her husband She's given birth three weeks prior She had a C-section and she was staying at her mother's house because that's like it's a a cultural thing And then her home is invaded and she was taken with her husband And even though she repeatedly told them that she had a C-section she had no involvement And they were asking her """"Why why were you having weapons why did you shoot at us?"""" And she was like """"I was at the hospital."""" And she showed them the scar They kept beating her on her scar She had to bleed And then they sexually assaulted her in front of her husband to get him to talk and to confess about things So they had soldiers and zip their pants and asking her to come sit on it in front of him and they also touched her breasts in front of him and they were both released like a week later So no serious allegations were brought against them Nothing uh official And then when I called the woman to follow up on the testimony she said she was at the hospital because because her husband who's 35 has had a heart attack and he couldn't handle the stressful situation And sometimes it's really hard to cover all of these testimonies when we try to see the patterns and speak generally about it But I thought I'd mention this one Where where did that happen neblas In Naples Oh Neblas Right Okay No Well thank you for that It's you know we try to draw the the patterns to to look at at the picture at a at a top level but it's it's the individual stories the individual experiences of of women and also of men and children that really form the basis of our work And so hearing those is very important Thank you for coming Thanks for the insights you bring but also the the insights and work of your organizations Um both of which I know and both of which are very important organizations Thank you Thank you""",,,,,,,,,,
TKengf78bls,H Sexual Harassment Prevention Panel  03282025  815 AM,2025-03-28T12:26:41Z,UCQXkUCDAVlCkzSdNeipFDkA,sexual harassment prevention,IN,0,1,0,,here he is you would be sequestered and you are I have a amendment I so we live now good morning everybody thank you for being here a little later 8:15 Molly bur chair of the house sexual harassment prevention panel it's the Friday the 28th of March and we are here to um go on a small change that was made u in our procedures and now I'm going to turn it over to our attorney Maggie faren okay so thank you everyone as we discussed last week um the ethics panel is making a couple of changes to their procedures one of which will allow them to share information with this panel and the house discrimination prevention panel um to form investigations that this panel does and that the Discrimination panel does um and that was the change that this panel wanted to make to this panel's procedures there were some other things in the changes to oh there are extra copies here um there are some other changes in the ethic panels procedures that didn't that weren't um deemed appropriate by this panel to change for this panel's rules um and so what I did was on page 8 of nine you'll see in the highlighted text rule 20e contains the general provision I'm sorry rule 20 contains the general um mandates for maintaining confidentiality and then I added subsection e which says not withstanding subsections a through D of this rule the panel May disclose information and Records received under these procedures to members or staff of the house ethics panel or the members um or staff of the house discrimination prevention panel to an informed investigation by either panel provided that members of Staff agree to maintain the confidentiality of the information or records provided and that mirrors the language um of that particular change in the ethics panel's procedures um and you'll note that it is uh permissive and not mandatory so this panel could get an inquiry from any of those other panels and decide on a case-by casee basis that it's not appropriate to speak to either panel or disclose but it does allow for that exchange of information um and then the only other thing I changed is on the last page and it's just a little housekeep clean up where it states that the office of human resources and the office of legis legislative Information Technology showing obtain the records of this panel it used to say um the office of legislative Council but since Daman is out of the biz and we're maintaining these records I think this just cleans it up and avoids any public records questions later on that you know you might have to poke around and see what they have as well that was just something that Daman suggested so change it so are we going to need um to go on these is that what we need to do right now um yeah any discussion on this to accept Chang I think I'm good too but could you give me an example of when it would be appropriate you you said that we can decide not to share when might we decide to share what kind of issue um well I think it's hard to say and and the thing that I was thinking of before that I was um that I mentioned to representative Hedrick was this panel had discussed when representative leand was here adding some language to their um to their procedural changes that would ensure that any public statement issued by the ethics panel doesn't include a reference to consulting or talking with this panel and I'd imagined in my head well what if we this panel makes this change today saying we can talk to them but they don't make a change that reflects a Prohibition on disclosing any conversation with this panel to the public for another two months if they were to in the interum under some rule that didn't um reflect what this panel was looking for in terms of saying you you can't say to the public that you talk to the sexual harassment prevention panel if they asked in the meantime could you do you have any information about X and Y respondents this panel would be perfectly within its rights to say we're not really comfortable with the procedural protections and your rules yet so we decline okay and I I mean I can't I'm having trouble off the top of my head thinking what would be appropriate and what wouldn't beyond that it's just I I I like how there's no there's nothing mandatory in this rule there's no requirement to disclose be honest I wish I wish it wasn't in here at all but everyone seems to be wanting this in here uh so I'm I'm okay with it but uh with skepticism I can conceive of a scenario where we're dealing where a complaint comes to this part this panel first and we follow our procedures and we learn of behavior that is egregious enough to want to involve another panel I I can see that happening that's what I was thinking okay yeah that it's not a a single incident or as as you do your investigation you find out this is widespread um involves some ethical violations or discrimination and violations as well as this as youve go through investigation and you might want to communicate with one of the other or in their investigation of whatever is they discover something that relates to us and they would like to be able to communicate to us yeah I understand that yeah and we would be like HR to like knowing knowing and being like we can't say anything that help resolve the situation the nature of what we deal with is so sensitive that I I really think we need to be very very careful about not letting it get out unnecessary right abely think one instance that was discussed would be if the ethics panel had a case in front of it and wanted to know whether a respondent had been subject to an investigation or a complaint by another panel because that might indicate a greater severity if it's repeated behavior and if the panels can't speak to one another I mean you could have the same person having been investigated by all three panels but each panel is treating any allegation as a first offense yeah okay that help yes it does thank you me just we got this um all in favor opposed right thank you panel and I appreciate everybody coming here multiple times at 8 o' in the morning a little later today to conduct our business important business not and I think we can do we want to um think we're going to end the meeting now
L0EOCnci6vM,The HR Insider Illinois Harassment Prevention The Official Training That Could Save Your Job,2025-03-27T16:00:05Z,UCZWSNDuaPTznZ9sdQ94oC3A,sexual harassment prevention,US,2,33,0,,welcome to Illinois harassment prevention training this training meets Illinois Human Rights Act IH requirements for annual mandatory workplace prevention effective January 1st 2020 all Illinois employers are required to provide annual sexual harassment training to all employees covering specific topics that we are going to review today so by the end of this presentation you will know what unlawful harassment is you'll understand if employer and employee responsibilities and understand the complaint reporting procedures and the concepts of no retaliation so we recently made a video on California harassment prevention training because different states have different compliance requirements and you can see from this Slide the differences between California and Illinois today we are covering the state of Illinois obviously but if you're interested in harassment prevention training for California check out that video that's Linked In the description box the content of this video is for informational purposes only it is not intended as legal advice laws and legal requirements regarding harassment prevention can vary by jurisdiction so this means you should verify the specific legal requirements that apply to you to your state and consult with a qualified attorney if you have any questions or need specific guidance and just so you know liking and subscribing is appreciated hi I'm harlo Reed employment lawyer HR consultant and creator of the HR Insider okay so did you know that more than 60% of people 60% of employees who face harassment at work never even bother to report it that's a staggering number considering the millions of workers that exist in the US and what's even more staggering is even when someone does speak up they don't see any real change or Justice well guys this creates an additional barrier to harassment prevention how can you prevent harassment if those people who are speaking up about it don't see the benefit of speaking up today we are talking about how to recognize these behaviors the right way to report them and how we can work together to prevent misconduct at work because everyone deserves a safe and respectful work environment this training includes real world examples legal definitions and interactive features so stay engaged and be ready to test your knowledge at the end with the quiz all right let's get started with this workplace harassment prevention training for Illinois harassment discrimination and retaliation have no business in our businesses they are without question question completely unacceptable over the last couple of years most workplaces have adopted a zero tolerance sexual harassment policy what used to be perceived by some as okay isn't anymore and likely never was allegations of sexual harassment or assault of a colleague a supervisor client or even a business contact can lead to the accused employees termination of employment and employees are now feeling more empowered than ever and that's a good thing but some unfortunately will take advantage of the changes in the workplace which is another reason why it's so important to take allegations of workplace harassment seriously the Illinois Human Rights Act IH prohibits sexual harassment and employment and it is a civil rights violation for any employer employee agent of any employer employment agency or labor organization to engage in sexual harassment the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which is also known as title 7 also prohibits sexual harassment the IH defines sexual harassment as any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a sexual nature when submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment and submission to or rejection of that conduct by an employee is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting that employee or the conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating hostile or offensive work environment okay so now that we've reviewed the definition let's turn our attention to what it means what does this definition mean in Practical terms and how it applies to employers and employees in their day-to-day work there are two types of sexual harassment quid pro quo and hostile work environment quid proquo is a Latin term that means this for that and sexual harassment occurs when someone typically a manager or supervisor someone with control and authority over another person makes unwelcome sexual advances or makes requests for sexual favors and going along with this behavior is either required to get or retain the job or it influences promotions and other work decisions that affect the person if you want to know more about workplace harassment laws and how they have developed over time and why standing up against harassment is so important you have to check out my video the sexual harassment case that changed everything the video shares insight about workplace harassment laws but it is also a powerful story about the courage one young woman took to make a difference in her workplace that ultimately changed the workplace for all of us so what would you do if you overheard a coworker making an inappropriate comment about another employees appearance what do you think would be the best way to handle it please pause the video take a moment to think about it and then share your response in the comment section now let's talk about the second kind of harassment hostile work environment a hostile work environment isn't just about having a bad boss or a coworker that curses a lot or someone who's annoying you at work the behavior has to meet specific legal requirements so what we're going to do now is look at how behaviors at work cross the line and become illegal harassment the first condition that has to be met for Behavior to be considered as harassment is unwelcome conduct this means the behavior is not invited it's not wanted and it makes someone uncomfortable if an employee is feeling pressured or disrespected or just overall uncomfortable about comments that are being made jokes that are being told or specific actions that make them feel uneasy that's considered unwelcome conduct and the person who's doing it doesn't have to intend to cause harm or intend to make the other person who's receiving and observing the behavior uncomfortable what matters is how it is received how the person who witnesses the behavior or the conduct or the words that are being spoken how that person feels the second condition is conduct that's based on a protected characteristic so for behaviors to legally qualify as a hostile work environment it has to be linked to an employes race gender gender religion disability age sexual orientation or another protected characteristic what we're talking about is when you are being treated unfairly because of who you are not because you have a disagreement with someone at work not because you have a conflict not because there's a personality issue but you are being singled out and treated differently because of who you are the third and final condition required to meet the legal standard for a hostile work environment is behavior that has a severe or pervasive impact on work that is being done and the behavior has to be so bad and so frequent that it negatively affects someone's job so a single inappropriate comment might not be enough but constant harassment ongoing intimidation or extreme behavior that makes work unbearable that would satisfy this third and final condition and this really matters because not every bad work environment is a legal hostile work environment but if behavior is unwelcome if it is discriminatory behavior and it is severe or happens enough to impact someone else's job it is illegal if you want to understand what it really means to work in a hospital environment check out my video workplace mobbing and retaliation in medicine it takes a really close look at the reality of workplace harassment and how toxic group Behavior can push employees out and the legal protections that exist plus you'll hear a very powerful story about a woman who stood against the odds to fight for her right to work in a harassment free environment so check it out out the link is in the description let's take a look at some examples of behavior that can make a workplace feel toxic it's important to remember that what may seem appropriate to you might be perceived as inappropriate and even hostile to someone else an open magazine left lying on your desk with models and swimsuits could be offensive and become the subject of a complaint harassment can be created through personal devices they can also be the subject of complaints and create liability for employers harassment can also show up in verbal and physical forms for example name calling insults or offensive jokes to others not to mention yelling aggressive behaviors the types of conduct that would intimidate an employee harassment can also be demonstrated through physical intimidation like blocking someone's movement or gestures that cause discomfort visual harassment can be anything that is visible to another worker like offensive posters cartoons drawings that are displayed at work or the act of sending inappropriate messages or suggestive emails or text messages this type of conduct is illegal and it can have serious consequences on an employes mental and emotional well-being not to mention the impact that it can have in the workplace so let's take a moment to think about this now what kind of behaviors do you think could create a hostile work environment and why do you think it's important for employers to step in early pause the video put a comment below because your thoughts matter and they will help someone else see things from a different perspective so let's talk about it in the comments unlawful harassment doesn't have to be sexual in nature it can be any type of harassment that is based on a protected characteristic and these are found under federal law like title 7 the age discrimination and Employment Act the Americans with Disability Act and specifically in Illinois under the IH Protections in Illinois include the following race color religion national origin ancestry sex age 40 years and older marital status disability military status sexual orientation gender identity unfavorable discharge from the military

this means that discrimination based on gender identity including transgender status or sexual orientation is considered sex discrimination under title 7 and harassment isn't limited to sexual conduct it also includes offensive comments that are related to someone's gender common issues that come up around this topic can involve uniforms restroom usage or inappropriate coworker comments or assumptions about gender roles if you'd like to learn more about harassment prevention and better understand the legal standards required to prove harassment check out my video she had five pages of evidence but it wasn't enough it's a real life case study that clearly shows what's needed and often times what is missing to meet the legal standard for harassment the term workplace extends far beyond the four walls of an office building it may include the office of course but also off-site areas that are used for work work rated events or meetings job related harassment is prohibited even if it occurs away from the work site for example harassment would be prohibited during a business trip or at a client's site a hostile work environment can happen anywhere there is no off-property exception harassment can occur anywhere that an employee represents their organization harassment includes conduct that occurs beyond the office if it arises out of the employment relationship managers have to watch their behavior after work when they are at a company function holiday party when they're traveling on business even when they are online the same workplace policies apply to any work-related situation even when offsite hey are you still watching if you find this video helpful please take a moment to like And subscribe your support really helps thanks anyone who comes into the workplace anyone who you associate with due to your work duties can create a hostile work environment third-party harassers can be an agent of the employer or a non-employee such as a contractor a consultant an intern or a regular visitor an employer can also be held liable for harassment by non-employees like customers if the employer knew or should have known of the harassment and then fail to take corrective action quickly promptly that was needed in order to resolve the issue whenever I conduct this training one of the more common questions that I get is how do I know if I have crossed the line and what I tell people is to picture sure someone you really care about someone that you respect someone that you actually want to protect either respect them you want to protect them now imagine them going through whatever the situation is that you are thinking about that has been brought to your attention or that you have experienced if it doesn't feel right for them the person that you want to protect the person that you respect then it's not right for anyone as a manager you have an additional layer of responsibility this means if something crosses that line you have to step up you have to step in you have to engage and exactly how you handle it can depend on what's going on but it usually means stopping the behavior immediately and notifying Human Resources under Illinois Law an employer can be held strictly liable for the acts of Supervisors who engage in harassment let's talk a little bit more about this and what it means under federal law supervisors and Managers generally aren't held personally liable meaning employees can't sue supervisors and managers directly but in Illinois it's different supervisors and managers can be held per personally liable under the Illinois Human Rights Act plus any employee can be personally sued under common law for things like battery false imprisonment or even intentional emotional distress in certain cases if that happens an employee would need to work closely with a lawyer and their actions will definitely be under close review and when harassment claims involve someone who is not a supervisor like a coworker or a customer the big questions are did the employer know about it or should they have known did they fail to take immediate steps to stop it and could they actually do something about it if the employer steps in quickly and handles the situation appropriately after finding out they might avoid being held legally responsible for what happened managers should always report any harassment situations that are brought to their attention any complaints to Human Resources right away they have to make sure that they take every complaint seriously and let the employee know who they are speaking with that is making the complaint that retaliation won't be tolerated always say that and then check in with the employee later to confirm that things have improved it's also important for leaders to document clearly what has happened and that the problem hasn't continued as a supervisor it's critical to escalate these concerns through the proper channels because the supervisors have a first line of sight they are the eyes and the ears for the organization and using that official Reporting System that's been created protects both the supervisor and the organization from liability never promise to keep something completely confid idential when speaking to an employee because you can't guarantee that one common issue I've seen in managers is when they know something is wrong but they fail to report it they fail to address it they fail to make human resources aware of it don't make that mistake always escalate and act promptly when issues of harassment are brought to your attention when harassment claims are successful employees can receive receive different types of compensation they can receive back pay for lost wages front pay for future income loss and even money for emotional distress or attorney fees under federal law that is under title 7 employees can also receive punitive damages or the person who is bringing the complaint against the employer can be awarded punitive damages and that is money that is specifically intended to punish an employer who ignored an employees rights in a very malicious uh intentional way for example one jury initially awarded a woman $95 million and then later reduced that to 40 million after severe sexual harassment at Aaron's rents uh but keep in mind under Illinois state law punitive damages aren't allowed under federal law if harassment doesn't result and a clear job loss or demotion the employer might avoid liability but only if they have a strong anti-harassment policy that everyone knew about and if the employee didn't speak up to complain um then they could also avoid the liability on the other hand in Illinois the law is tougher if a supervisor harasses someone the company is automatically responsible there are no exceptions and that's one of the reasons why it is so important for employers to take reasonable steps to stop discrimination and harassment from happening in the first place when issues do come up employers need to act quickly to put a stop to it and to fix any problems that it's caused employees should have clear ways to speak up and communicate their concerns employers need to investigate every complaint fully promptly care carefully and if it's needed they should discipline or correct the behavior right away but remember employers can't fix problems they don't know about So speaking up is important if someone feels they've experienced harassment they should immediately check the company's complaint process and let HR or whoever else is designated know about the issue the company then has an obligation to quickly start an investigation and handle the situation as fairly and confidentially as possible it's also important that everyone cooperates during these investigations anyone found guilty of harassment discrimination or retaliation could face serious consequences anything from a warning up to losing their job also keep in mind that the person reporting the issue isn't guaranteed to get the exact outcome they want the company's respon ibility is to make sure the investigation is prompt thorough and fair and then make decisions based on the evidence if employees are involved in consensual workplace relationships the company might have a policy on that too like a love contract or requirement to disclose those relationships so employees should be aware of those policies and make sure that they follow those guidelines if you hear about witness experience harassment talk to human resources or management immediately and always write down the details make sure someone addresses the situation right away and be ready to help with the investigation by providing facts and details afterwards stay involved and make sure that you follow up on the issue until it's fully resolve excuses any excuse is not a reason not to report a harassment claim or an issue with harassment in the workplace things like it didn't happen at work or she never complained or it was a one-time thing those types of reasons do not believe supervisors or employers from liability supervisors they have an obligation to immediately report any complaints of harassment using the method that's been designated by the employer and they are also oblig to allow the investigation process to play out no excuses so what should you do if you experience or witness harassment at work let's talk about the steps you should take the first step is to document what has happened write down the date time and location what happened how it made you feel and save any relevant email messages or evidence if you're comfortable consider confronting the harass describe the behavior that bothers you why it's a problem how you feel and how it affects your environment tell the harasser that the harassing conduct must stop and explain how you would prefer the situation be handled inform the harasser that if the harassing Behavior continues you will complain to management the next step is to report what you have seen or experienced to human resources or management managers and supervisors are held to a higher standard than nonsupervisory employees when it comes to harassment prevention they are required to take immediate action if they witness or become aware of harassment if you are a coworker who learns about harassment listen and if the harassed person is comfortable suggest that he or she confront the alleged harasser offer to practice the confrontation and suggest supportive feedback encourage the person to report the harassment to the person or Department that the harassment policy designates to receive these types of complaints and you should also report it yourself if you are the alleged harasser that is you are the person who's being confronted about your own behavior the first thing to do is to listen try not to be defensive keep an open mind even if if you disagree stop the offending Behavior if possible express your willingness to address the situation and if you cannot stop the behavior tell your supervisor speak with management or human resources it's important to remember that if you are the alleged harasser you need to maintain a normal working relationship with the person who is accusing you or confronting you about harassment don't retaliate against the employee for his complaint or her concerns cooperate with them tell them the truth in the investigation and don't spread rumors about the situation always remember the protect and respect test that we talked about earlier if the conduct is not appropriate for the person that you want to protect person that you respect then it's not appropriate for a coworker either retaliation and bullying are another form of harassment and the behaviors are closely linked together because when an employee is subjected to bullying it's often triggered by retaliatory actions which is why these issues are typically linked and addressed together retaliation occurs when an employer takes an adverse action or a negative action really against an employee for reporting harassment or participating in an investigation this not only harms the individual employee but also discourages others from coming forward ultimately creating a work Culture of Fear and silence examples of retaliation include being demoted or fired after filing a complaint a demotion salary reduction or unfounded and illegitimate disciplinary actions having work hours cut for speaking up about misconduct or even termination it's important to know that the law protects employees from retaliation and that helps make sure that when employees do have the courage to speak up or to help out in an investigation that they're not going to be punished for their efforts to promote a safe and respectful work environment if you want to know more about retaliation at work check out my video workplace retaliation it covers the legal case between the University of

7I18WUESEQE,How to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace  8 essential steps,2025-03-26T15:41:09Z,UCaOx9OguP5RUxvnCdIdJATg,sexual harassment prevention,GB,0,6,0,,"so a bit about myself my name is Brendan Bar i'm an employment law advisor at LCF Law i have over 25 years HR experience across a number of different sectors including civil service retail manufacturing education NHS logistics and more recently the care sector i possess a wide range of experience dealing with a large employee relations case load including serious and complex allegations of sexual harassment i now support LCF works clients advising them across the full remit of employment law and HR issues lcf works is the firm's retainer service which pro we provide to employers who either may not have their own HR department or require specialist advice i also assist individuals and other companies who may need support with specific issues a new offer we have is that I'm able to act as in-house HR support for clients for example carrying out investigations and holding disciplinaries or other hearings the following webinar is entitled taking reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment this webinar is about the new legal duty employers have to prevent sexual harassment it will cover the reason for the webinar what is sexual harassment what does the law require and expect of employers what can your organization do to prevent sexual harassment what does a sexual harassment policy need to cover what are the possible sanctions for both employer and employee and how your organization should deal with any allegations on the 26th of October 2024 as an amendment to the Equality Act 2010 the government implemented the Worker Protection Act 2023 this introduced a legal duty for employers to take reasonable steps to prevent the sexual harassment of their employees as a result of the new requirements employees now need to show they are taking positive action and not just dealing with the aftermath but being proactive in dealing with sexual harassment as part of the employee rights bill which was announced prior to this legislation the government also announced a possible further amendment which if introduced will mean employers will need to take all reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment whilst it has not been defined what all reasonable steps looks like it has been reported that some statutory legislation may be introduced following the publication of an amendment paper at the beginning of March another amendment that has been proposed is to increase the allowed time limit for bringing employment tribunal claims relating to sexual harassment from three months to 12 months so this means that if employees do suffer from sexual harassment they will have 12 months to bring their claim at an employment tribe email rather than the 3 months it is now following several surveys it was found that three in five women and one in three men have suffered from sexual harassment in the workplace alarmingly of this number 70% of the women and 80% of the men did not report the cases with reasons for non-reporting ranging from not being taken seriously negative impact on work relationships and damaging career prospects while these figures are worrying there is a real impetus for change as shown by the Me Too movement there have also been a high number of a number of high-profile cases recently as such it's important that you have robust procedures in place to support individuals and deal with any allegations what is sexual harassment and what does the law require your organization to do your organization will probably already have policies that cover harassment bullying and victimization this session has been specifically created to cover sexual harassment in the workplace the Equality Act defines sexual harassment as unwanted behavior of a sexual nature which has the purpose or effect of violating dignity creating a hostile degrading offensive or intimidating environment the harassment does not have to be motivated by sexual interest nor does it have to be specifically directed at anyone equally it does not matter how the behavior is intended the effect may still constitute sexual harassment ultimately it would be for a tribunal to determine if someone's behavior was intended to have one of these effects but it's important to note that when considering whether the conduct has the effect of violating dignity or creating one of the environments highlighted on this slide the tribunal will take into account section 264 of the Equality Act which states that it also needs to consider the victim's perception the other circumstances of the case which can include the victim's past experience and whether it is reasonable for the conduct to have that effect i.e objectively would others have felt it was sexual harassment this webinar and the draft sexual harassment policy we have produced are for those occurrences where the definitions of sexual harassment are met attendees will receive a draft sexual harassment policy which will be sent out following the webinar however should you have any further questions please feel free to contact us directly we've covered the legal definition of sexual harassment sorry but what could it look like in the workplace some common examples are sexual advances sexual jokes gestures comments or personal questions inappropriate touching and sexual assault displaying of pornographic photos or drawings spreading lies or rumors about a person's sex life wolf whistling or cat calling are our dirty terms of endearment such as sweetheart darling babe honey etc these are just some of the recent cases involving sexual harassment in the workplace the female trainee project manager was awarded 360,000 at tribunal for the sexual harassment she suffered and numerous other issues the male employee who was harassed by a female headteer was awarded 9,000 at a remedy hearing and the female designer harassed at a work Christmas party was awarded 19,000 at tribunal as can be seen there is no distinction with regards to gender profession or seniority for either the complainant or the perpetrator so how is your company liable and what could the penalties be section 109 of the Equality Act states that employers are liable for discriminatory acts of employees during the course of their employment in other words this means that if an employee commits an act of discrimination you as their employer are liable for any compensation awarded you can as a business however show that you took reasonable steps to prevent that act of discrimination taking place section 40A is a new provision which states that employers must take reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment and if they don't they will not only be liable for their employees actions as per section 109 but that in line with another section new section 124A that compensation can be increased by up to 25% the comp any compensation ordered can include financial loss if the employee was unable to work for a period of time lost salary or if they did not receive a pay rise bonus as a result of sexual harassment this can also be adjusted to include future loss injury to feelings any compensation paid can also include an award for injury to feelings compensation payments related to injury to feelings are calculated under three bands these are called the vento bands the lower band which is for less serious cases where the act of discrimination may be an isolated or one-off occurrences occurrence is 1,200 to 11,700 the middle band which is for serious cases but which do not merit an award in the highest band 11,700 to 35,200 and the upper band which is for the most serious cases such as where there has been a lengthy campaign of discriminatory harassment and this ranges from 35200 to 58,700 it should be noted that some in some exceptional cases an award for injury to feelings may exceed the upper band when calculating compensation tribunals will focus on the effect the discriminity act has had on the individual taking into account a number of factors before deciding on an amount these factors could include the vulnerability of the client claimant the degree of hurt distress or upset caused and the position of the harasser and the seriousness of the treatment the Equality and Human Rights Commission has developed several pieces of guidance to support employers in taking reasonable steps to prevent the sexual harassment of their workers as part of this they have outlined eight practical steps that employers can take to prevent and deal with sexual harassment in the workplace whilst this is not an exhaustive list it's implementing these steps should help you take positive action to prevent and deal with sexual harassment at work step one developing an effective anti-harassment policy step two engaging with staff step three assessing and taking steps to reduce workplace risk step four reporting step five training step six handling harassment complaints step seven dealing with third party harassment and step eight monitoring and evaluating actions we will we will look at the eight steps in more detail and how you can utilize them to help you fulfill your legal duty to prevent sexual harassment in the next few slides as I have mentioned previously with the changes coming from the employment rights bill it could be that some of these steps become statutory legislation the first step an employer can take is to have an effective antisexual harassment policy the policy should include a number of relevant points confirm who the policy covers state that sexual harassment is unlawful and will not be tolerated provide a definition of what sexual harassment is state what the consequences are of being found guilty of sexual harassment set out a range of options for dealing with harassment state what will be taken into account in deciding what action may be taken and explain how employees can raise a complaint although this should not be too restrictive and put employees off from reporting concerns and allegations it should also explain what third party harassment is and it should provide details of any internal or external support it may also be beneficial to consider whether there are any other policies that could be imple implemented alongside an anti-harassment policy such as a relationships at work policy again as an employer you don't want to stop relationships from happening however a large number of allegations do come from the breakdown of a relationship following this webinar you will have a draft policy to use however if you require further support with drafting any other policies we can help with this so please feel free to get in touch step two there is no point in having a policy if staff are not aware of it as such engaging with staff is a vital step in taking positive action ensure staff know you have a specific policy where it can be found put up posters in staff communal areas to make people aware discuss the policy and any issues in team meetings and briefings ensure staff know who how and where they can report issues to discuss in oneto ones and run staff surveys and have specific questions on sexual harassment in the workplace and finally hold exit interviews some staff may be more willing and less reluctant to discuss ifs issues if they are leaving step three undertaking risk assessments and reducing risk these can help you comply with the preventative duty consider the factors that might increase the opportunity for sexual harassment and the steps you can take to minimize them so where are the power imbalances which staff have responsibility for rotors or staff incentives do teams lack diversity do they consist of more of one group than another are there any specific roles with less job security lower paid roles may be more susceptible to abuses of power do staff often work alone or during the night there may be less management oversight or support available are staff customerf facing is there an increased risk for third-party harassment is there alcohol on site alcohol lowers inhibitions and may make people more likely to act inappropriately are staff required to attend external events are there risks that are outside of your control do staff socialize outside of work whilst you don't want to stop staff from socializing they need to be aware that dependent on circumstances this could still be included in the definition of workplace and finally what is your work culture are banter and crude comments the norm equally there may also be certain times of the year or even week when instances of sexual harassment may be more likely to occur as we know staff parties or some attendees can at times get out of hand and it's often a nervous time for managers and HR departments this could also be the case with large-scale sporting or music events where people may be more likely to act differently than they would normally this is equally relevant to staff and third parties it may be worth reminding staff of the policy and their personal obligations before such events step four reporting businesses should keep a centralized confidential record of all concerns raised either formally or informally this will support managers in recognizing recurring issues or trends enable things and enable things to be put in place to prevent them in the future you could consider using an independent reporting system such as an online or telephone system how and staff may feel more comfortable raising issues anonymously although it should be noted that there are some downsides to anonymous reporting systems in that it can often be more difficult to investigate allegations if you are unable to talk directly to the affected individual step five training all employees including managers and senior staff should undertake regular training which should cover what constitutes sexual harassment in the workplace how to recognize unacceptable behavior what to do if you experience or witness sexual harassment and the company and personal obligations in industries where third-party harassment is more likely such as hospitality staff should also be trained on how to recognize and address these issues handling complaints staff responsible for dealing with allegations should also undertake training to cover how to handle complaints of harassment training should be reviewed to ensure its effectiveness and refresher sessions should be held on a regular bas basis recent case law suggests that any training provided must be kept up to date in one case an employer was unable to rely on the defense of taking all reasonable steps to prevent discrimination when the training had provided had taken place 2 years before the act complained of step six handling complaints how you deal with a complaint or allegation is also important as such it is vital that when an allegation or complaint it is dealt with immediately act quickly to deal with the complaint taking into account how the individual wants it to be resolved respect the confidentiality of all parties this includes the complainant any witnesses and the alleged perpetrator protect the complainant and any witnesses from any ongoing harassment or retaliation for raising a complaint remember 37% of people said the reason they didn't report an issue was due to it negatively impacting workplace relationships harassment can be classed as a criminal offense so speak to the individual about whether they want to raise the issue with the police or other external organization confidentiality agreements or NDAs should only be used where it is lawful necessary and appropriate to do so the employment rights bill currently going through parliament contains a clause banning the use of NDAs for sexual harassment disclosures always communicate the outcome of any investigation to the complainant and outline any appeals process remembering to maintain confidentiality step seven third party harassment harassment by third parties such as customers patients clients or suppliers should be treated just as seriously as that by colleagues steps should be taken to prevent this type of harassment including policies reporting mechanisms and/or assessing areas where staff may interact with third parties how you handle complaints and allegations is important for all concerned parties as such we will go into more detail around how you should deal with the complaints later in the presentation step eight monitoring and evaluation as with training it's important to regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the steps you put in place and implement any changes needed this will help underpin your ongoing duty to take reasonable steps to prevent the sexual harassment of your employees ways in which you can evaluate the effectiveness of the steps you've taken are review informal and formal complaints data to identify any patterns trends or particular issues and what actions were taken survey staff anonymously on their experiences of sexual harassment including whether they have witnessed or been subject to harassment whether it was reported and if not why not and what further steps they think you could take compare reported complaints against survey feedback to ensure you have an accurate reflection of the level of harassment and take appropriate actions hold lessons learned sessions for key staff after any complaints of sexual harassment are resolved policies procedures and as previously mentioned training should all be reviewed regularly especially if you are still receiving complaints it is also beneficial to seek input from staff or their representatives to consider if any further changes are needed and these should be be implemented where appropriate consider whether there have been any changes to the workforce or workplace that could mean there are further steps it might be reasonable to take employee sanctions as well as facing disciplinary action employees may face other sanctions they could lose their job they might be banned from working in their chosen profession they may also be personally sued and they could be found personally liable for any compensation awarded at a tribunal often when individuals bring claims of harassment and/or discrimination they will bring those claims against both the employer and the alleged perpetrator and if both are found culpable then both can be responsible for any compensation awarded this is called several liability where liability is several it is possible to proceed against each entity individually and recover from each entity individually however if an employer can show it took reasonable step to prevent harassment taking place such as implementing the eight steps in the previous slides then it may be the perpetrator who alone is found culpable for any compensation equally if the allegations are serious enough they could receive a prison sentence this can often be one of the most powerful messages to get across to employees as once they understand they may be personally liable they may be less likely to harass people so in summary sexual harassment is defined as unwanted behavior of a sexual nature which violates your dignity and makes you feel intimidated degraded or humiliated or which creates a hostile or offensive environment anyone regardless of gender age role or profession can be a victim or perpetrator employers and employees can be held liable for complaints of harassment implementing the eight steps provided by the EHRC can support employers to comply with their positive legal duty to take reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment it's important to remember that just having a policy is not enough for an employer to rely on the statutory defense employees must be made aware of the policy and should be provided with training explaining what harassment is and what they shouldn't do both employer and employees can face sanctions if an employee is found guilty of sexual harassment however an employer can show that they took reasonable steps to prevent this employees can lose their job be personally sued and receive a prison sentence we can support with any training that you may need for your staff please contact me directly if this is something you would be interested in we touched earlier in the presentation on how you should handle complaints and how important this is as such we will go into more detail about this over the next few slides your organization has a duty of care to protect its employees it can be held vicariously liable for the actions of its employees it should investigate all allegations of harassment it should review current policies and procedures and adopt measures to prevent it from happening depending on the invest in the in depending on the industry sorry you are in it may be necessary to report behavior to a regulatory body or other external organizations such as DBS the local authority the GMC or the SR handling sexual harassment step one seriousness all complaints should be taken seriously we have previously mentioned that between 70 and 80% of those who have been harassed did not report the incident with the main reason being that they wouldn't be taken seriously if you do not show that this is a serious matter it will send a negative message to staff it may stop other people from reporting issues and it may also make other people think they can get away with it the longer it takes to respond and react to a complaint the less impact it will have discuss with the complainant how the allegation will be dealt with and by who you should also discuss with the complainant how they would like the issue to be dealt with either informally or formally although this is somewhat dependent on the complainant you should also consider the seriousness of any allegation step two support raising allegations can be very distressing for all parties concerned confidentiality should be maintained at all stages of the process you should support the complainant and any possible witnesses you may have your own employee assistance program equally there are a number of external providers that that can provide support to affected individuals you may also consider keeping the parties apart while any investigation is ongoing you could depending on the seriousness of the allegations choose to suspend the alleged perpetrator step three investigation investigations should be conducted fairly sensitively and confidentially investigations are purely factf finding exercises they are not there to aortion blame or guilt they should focus purely on the allegations and what happened from all parties sides so plan your investigation think of questions you could ask beforehand what information are you trying to gather use open questions use five W's who what where when and witnesses don't put words in people's mouths give people the opportunity to speak ask questions such as ""Can you explain what happened can you explain what you saw what is your recollection of the events did anyone else witness the incident?"" Similar questions can be amended depending on who you were talking to either the complainant witnesses or the perpetrator investigation should be unbiased we would advise having someone there to take notes of any meetings maintaining confidentiality this will ensure that there is no disagreement between what has been said dependent on the seriousness of the allegations you may let the complainant or other witnesses or the perpetrator be supported during the investigation process although this is not a legal requirement accurate records of any statements or interviews should be taken and kept these will need to be provided should the matter be progressed further managers should consider if any other relevant parties need to be notified do the complainant's manager or colleagues need to be made aware how can this be done sensitively keeping confidentiality in check discuss with the complainant about making other people aware who may need to know and why for support etc what you are trying to do as an investigator is to be able to make a decision given the evidence and statements as to whether you believe there is a case to answer and should the issue be forwarded to disciplinary it is not the investigator's remit to say whether the perpetrator is guilty of the allegations or what any possible outcome should be other than if there is a case to answer we can provide support and guidance around any investigation and disciplinary processes equally as previously mentioned we able to come into your business and run any investigations and/or hearings for you step four outcome how you deliver the outcome is just as important as how you deal with the rest of the process maintain confidentiality for all parties remembering that the perpetrator has the same rights to confidentiality as the complainant and any witnesses outline any appeals process continue to support any individuals involved they could be impacted physically mentally and emotionally for a long period of time advise the complainant if you pass the information to any other parties again maintaining confidentiality if the perpetrator has committed a criminal offense then you should notify the relevant authorities do not use NDAs to stop people from discussing complaints the employment rights bill includes a specific clause which would make the use of NDAs for raising harassment allegations including those for sexual harassment illegal following any allegations review current processes and procedures taking into account the specifics of the case this can include policies and procedures are they fit for purpose training is this up to date have all employees completed it and the work environment has anything changed so such as workplace or staffing so in summary you have a legal duty to protect your employees from sexual harassment this includes putting steps in place before any issues are raised not just dealing with complaints after they have happened all allegations of sexual harassment should be taken seriously you should support support the complainant and any witnesses both during any process and after allegations should be investigated fairly sensitively and confidentially accurate records and notes should be taken and kept deliver the outcome to all relevant parties as soon as is reasonably practical remembering the confidentiality of all parties remember employees should be made aware that they can also be held responsible for allegations of sexual harassment this means they could be sued held liable for any compensation or even sent to prison we have received some questions in the Q&A text so we will look at those now so the first question is is complimenting someone on their appearance classed as sexual harassment such as that dress looks nice no that wouldn't be classed as sexual harassment as long as it's not of a sexual nature saying something like that dress looks nice is fine however saying something like that dress makes your bum look nice would be classed as sexual harassment second question a colleague said they overheard someone say something inappropriate what can I do i would say what you need to do is raise it with the relevant people initially such as HR um you could speak to the individual direct however I would raise it with HR initially and make sure that people are aware of it the conversations and the comments don't need to be aimed at any individuals to be classed as sexual harassment next question is ""A lot of our staff socialize after work could this still be classed as sexual harassment in the workplace?"" Yes it can just because something has happened outside of the actual workplace it could still be classed as happening at work as such you have a legal duty to take positive action and action against that could anyone be the perpetrator absolutely anyone of any age any gender any seniority um anyone can be the gender as shown in the previous slides with the three um complaints it ranged from everybody within an employee within an employer and an organization next question somebody was made aware of an incident from three months ago can you still do something yes you can still record and report the allegations um it may be more difficult to investigate and do something about it given the time scales as people will often forget what happened and not be willing to talk because it happened so long ago but you still have a legal duty of care to look into those allegations yes and how much can someone be awarded for a sexual harassment claim to be honest a sexual harassment claim it's the the actual award is unlimited um as we've said previously that it can be looked at for future loss as well and adjusted for future loss um and also the injury to feelings awards can go up very high one of the on one of the incidents we've had somebody won 300 was awarded sorry £360,000 um at tribunal for numerous allegations and numerous instances of harassment that she'd suffered oh another we have another question a senior manager who hugs people he has done this for years um and nobody has ever complained should we tackle the issue before anyone complains absolutely you should tackle the issue as I've said the new duty is a positive legal duty so you have to take positive action which means tackling sexual harassment before it happens so if you know something like this is already happening and it could lead to a claim for sexual harassment then yes you should deal with it immediately and as quickly as possible obviously you keeping sensitive and confidentiality as well are there resources available to help victims of sexual harassment there are a number of resources both nationally and locally um you may have your own employee assistance program which can help equally a number of external bodies the equality advisory and support service can help um there's a support service called protect victim support and rape crisis these are all national support organizations so there may be local ones in your area that may be more useful for you we have a supplier client customer who is very flirty with all the female staff nothing has ever happened as far as we know should we raise this with them yes this would be classed under third party harassment it should be raised with somebody whether this is with them directly or their employer just because nothing has happened doesn't mean it isn't an issue it comes down to how people feel about this remember between 70 and 80% of people don't officially report issues so another question would there be a difference in sanctions issued if the issue occurred at an afterwork event compared to during work event no it depends if it's a work event although it's outside of work times it would still be classed as workplace sexual harassment as such there would be no difference in the sanctions um as I stated previously work events can and should be classed as workplace um especially if it is a work event so no there shouldn't be any san there should be shouldn't be any difference in sanctioned issued outside of work the perpetrator may want to argue that it wasn't a work event but I think if you've done your full investigation then you can show that it was still classed as a work event if work people were there are there going to be any further changes when the employment rights bill comes into force yes yeah we already know that they're increasing the time frame for being able to put in claims from three months to 12 months we are of the understanding that one of the changes to change from taking reasonable steps to all reasonable steps and this is we think likely going to include some legislation um that is statutory um such as maybe a policy and procedures um and following the employee human rights convention eight steps we will issue the draft policy to attendees shortly if you have any questions on this topic or if you are interested in our LCF works package or how LCF law can support your business please contact either myself or James Austin as previously mentioned the employment rights bill is currently making its way through parliament so we are anticipating a large number of legislative changes going forward we will hopefully be running more webinars and events as well as publishing articles and blogs as new legislation is implemented so keep an eye out for what's coming up equally if there's anything you would be interested in seeing or hearing about please feel free to contact us direct"

0GtzMcIxwlo,Workplace Harassment Prevention What Managers Need to Know,2025-03-20T12:01:42Z,UCJUIgpUSbIqklHAkdjdZRqA,sexual harassment prevention,IN,0,7,0,,today we're going to talk about workplace harassment prevention from a management perspective and let me start by saying that today's class is very much from the perspective of what managers need to know um I know sometimes people attend webinars with the intent of utilizing what they've learned to deploy training within their own organizations and that is wonderful I would just like to State very clearly that this is not the approach to take when you're doing harassment prevention training with your employees it's this topic is very different when directed toward managers versus directed toward employees employee training is focused more on what your policy is what is and is not acceptable making sure they understand the types of things that represent harassment workplace harassment that is legally defined as well as other you know professionalism uh uh implications and what to do if they feel the craft or discriminated against and that's about the extent one would go with training their employees this is a very different perspective managers need to know those things but they also need to know what their responsibilities are as supervisors and how liability is created for their organization so this is a much deeper dive into the compliance and um navigating comp compliance associated with this very complex topic and of course we are focusing on um anti-discrimination anti-harassment laws specific to the US in this particular program and in the US there are a number of laws that are associated with anti-harassment as well as anti-discrimination actually all of the laws are anti-discrimination laws because harassment by definition is a specialized form of discrimination and all of the laws that address anti-discrimination anti-harassment group together they're referred to as the family of equal employment opportunity laws and these laws all prohibit employers from negatively impacting employees with regards to terms and conditions of employment on the basis of what are called protected characteristics and we will explore what all of those characteristics are from a federal perspective but when I say that you can't negatively impact employees that means employees are protected against negative or differential treatment with regards to all terms and conditions of employment including but not limited to things like firing demoing denying access to employment denying access to training harassing or otherwise we're doing things that would be retaliatory against individuals on the basis of protected characteristics and a few things that as a manager or an HR professional um because certainly this is a topic that HR professionals need to be knowledgeable about and really even need to have a deeper understanding of this complicated area of compliance than managers even but managers and HR professionals need to be be be crystal clear on the fact that when we talk about protected characteristics that that is exactly what it means it's the characteristic that is not protect that is protected not minority status a lot of times I'll hear manager say things like oh you know be careful what you say to her she's a women a woman women are protected woman is not a protected characteristic sex is a protected characteristic people can't be treated different ly or negatively on the basis of their sex whatever their sex is the protection does not apply to what is or is perceived as the minority in the population or any particular workplace it would be just as unlawful to deny access to Promotions to someone because they are a man as it would be to deny the same to someone because they are a woman and it's very important to know that there are a few of the protected characteristics that truly are classes which means some people are protected and some people are not age for example is a class under federal law age protection starts at 40 some people are over 40 some people are under 40 people who are under 40 under Federal US law cannot experience age-based discrimination because they're not in that protective class but everybody has a sex everybody has a national origin everybody has Race For example and there are 11 federally protected characteristics we will look at all of them so these anti-discrimination and anti-harassment laws they also don't say that people need to be treated better because of a characteristic than others no and and that's a common misperception oh I have to give preference to I have to be careful with no what the laws say is that people are to be treated with without regard to protected characteristic status when you are determining whether or not to hire someone you should base that decision on factors relevant to whether or not they can perform the job and whether someone is male or female what someone's national origin is in almost every situation is has no relevance to whether they can perform the job so those decisions have to be made with without regard to protected characteristic status and if we were all in a room together for a live training session I would ask you all what does without regard mean and wait for you to respond and usually when I ask that question people just sort of look at me like I've you know grown another arm and because what does without regard mean I mean the answer is in the question it means without regard without regard means without regard protected characteris can't enter into employment related decisions in any way shape or form no or should it affect how we refer to people how we communicate with people how we treat people in the workplace if I'm your employee and I do a good job say way to go Mary you did a great job don't say way to go Mary you did a great job for a girl a way to go little lady that's not treatment that is without regard same thing as if you said big fellow or whatever term that some people assume some people truly think those terms are complimentary but the reality is is that that the intent doesn't matter without regard means without regard it should not enter into the workplace and here's where your responsibility as a supervisor kicks in because people do and say all kinds of things to each other at work that they clear clearly do associate with protected characteristic and when the supervisor becomes aware of that it's important for you to recognize that it's an issue and put a stop to it and failure to do that creates or even exacerbates I should say liability for your organization and it so it is unlawful to use any kind of protective characteristic information to make any kind of employment decision with the exception of those situations would truly truly constitute legally defensible Bonafide occupational qualifications and those are few and far between and it's also important to note that supervisors and the companies in which they work can be liable for workplace harassment even if they didn't know about it because the equal employment opportunity commission which is EEOC and the court use a standard of should have know hear me clearly when I say that if an investigation reveals that it was openly practiced or widely known if everybody heard my manager consistently referring to me as little lady or good for a girl and that's just part of the culture and part of the communication well that represents a pattern of hostile environment harassment that is openly practiced and widely known and management can scream we didn't know all they want but if all the other employees are aware of it and you know when an investigator says to them what kind of thing how does your boss congratulate you and that's the language that gets conveyed to them that liability is going to be there you can scream didn't know all you want but if it's part of the culture if it's part of how people interact with each other should have known is going to apply and as far as the EEOC is concerned it is a responsibility of the organization to ensure that managers know their responsibility and I would imagine that that's probably the reason why some of you are in attendance today so this is all tied to um a complex legal environment related to equal access to employment that can be traced back to um 1964 when the Civil Rights Act went into effect in the United States this was the first piece of legislation focusing on equal access to employment and it defined five characteristics as protected which means these are five characteristics that people have to be can't be impacted in terms of access to employment or any terms and conditions of employment on the basis of these characteristics now some of you may be thinking wait a minute you said that there are 11 and that's right there are as of 1964 the the first five were defined and the other six have been defined through additional legislation since then Civil Rights Act is not the only equality focused legislation in the US so the Civil Rights Act defined as protected um race national origin and ethnicity or defined together color sex and religion everybody has a race everybody has a national or origin and an ethnicity technically they're different things but for all intents and purposes this means where you came from in terms of ancestry back to the beginning of time your national origin is the country in which you originated you were born ethnicity is ancestry all the way back everybody is a color has a color has a shade has a skin tone this applies specifically to skin everybody has a sex and everybody either we live as far as religion goes people either have a religion or they don't and they have a constitutionally protected right to be any religion they want or no religion at all people can't be treated differently because of what their religion is or isn't can't be put down or denied access to any terms and conditions of employment and this doesn't apply to mainstream religions because again no establishment that is part of the constitution of the US there is no establishment of religion so um and some sometimes issues arise with people get into their minds that it's okay to be any religion you want unless it's X religion or Y religion whatever that may be and employers don't get to decide that we don't get to decide what is and is not a valid religion so that was the first five protected characteristics and um once the Civil Rights Act was passed that set in motion a chain of events that led to additional laws related to equal access and I want you to hear me very clearly when I say equal access do not ever let the phrase quote reverse discrimination come out of your mouth because that there is no such thing the characteristics are protected every race is protected every religion is protected every national origin is protected every sex is protected every color is protected you can't treat people differently or negatively on the basis of any of these characteristics now Beyond Civil Rights Act I mentioned the age uh age earlier age is truly a class because age protection starts at 40 that protection was defined under the age discrimination and Employment Act in 1967 a little over 10 years later the pregnancy Discrimination Act came along and specifies that employers cannot treat people differently on the basis of pregnancy or any um pregnancy related condition anything associated with pregnancy is a point of non-discrimination and what the law basically says is that you have to treat pregnancy the same as any kind of temporary circumstance that might impact someone's ability to do their job you if I'm supposed to stand up at work but I break my ankle and I need to sit down and you let me then the pregnant person who needs to sit down you need to let that person do it you can't deny people access to employment based on pregnancy and all too often in 2019 many many years after this law went into effect in 1979 I'll have I'll hear managers and even HR colleagues say you know we hired so and so and can you believe she didn't even tell us she was pregnant When She interviewed isn't that awful and I'm like no you can't ask her that you can't use that information to make employment decisions what difference does it make if she tells you or not if she tells you and you choose not to hire her you broke at least one law I would argue two um I would argue that's a civil rights um violation as well because that would also be sex-based discrimination it's not like people who weren't women could be discriminated against on that basis um citizenship is protected under the immigration reform and Control Act and before anybody starts yelling no one is saying that you need to hire people who are not legally authorized to work in the US as a matter of fact it is unlawful for us employers to hire employ or continue to employ people who are not legally authorized to work in this country that's why we have to get I nin from people that's why many many employers very wisely use e verify to ensure that the people they are hiring are who they say they are and who have the authorization to work in this country but and that's the same law the immigration reform and Control Act also specifies that you can't use the fact that someone is not aist citizen if they are legally authorized to work in the States you can't use that as the reason to exclude them from consideration for hire um military status and obligations are also protected this applies to past present and future military service or obligations so I mean some people are in or have been in the military and some people have not so in that case it's a class but you have to also have to understand the future like as a manager if you try to dissuade your employees from going from entering military service which has happened and the Veterans Administration has actually dealt with complaints related to managers telling employees that they shouldn't pursue military service even those those employees aren't in the military at the time that happens that future is is protected as well but so is that one is a class but it's a little more complicated than it seems at face value disability is also a protected characteristic um the Americans of Disabilities Act was passed in 1990 and was updated significantly in 2008 disability applies to um physical or mental impairments that substantially limit an individual's ability to perform one or more um of life's major activities with or without a reasonable accommodation so extraordinarily complex area of employment law the best advice I can give for managers related to disability is for any situation with an employee that you even think might be disability related to get HR involved before pursuing the matter um but we can't discriminate at against people on the basis of a disability now nobody and a common misperception there is that you have to hire people who can't do the job and then let them out of doing the job and that is not the case reasonable accommodation means finding a way to make it possible for the person to do the job and if there's not a way to do that or if the way would really put the company in a situation of an undue hardship then there's no obligation to do that but you should try carefully and you should seek legal counsel in such situations the 11th protected characteristic is really genetic information but what that means we're talking about it in this context things we can't harass or discriminate on the basis of is a person's family medical history you know a an individual's own medical condition that could be their disability but something that runs in that person's family that is genetic information you know if you knew you had an employee who had a relative who had a condition with the genetic basis we just say breast cancer for example and you decide oh I'm not going to promote her because this runs in her family and we know it's genetic and so therefore we don't want to put her in that job because she might get sick and leave that would be an example of discrimination and harassment based on genetic information but so would calling somebody nicknames or picking on them about it in the case of genetic information even asking them to provide genetic information to you could constitute an issue like if an employee comes to you and says you know my mother has been diagnosed with breast cancer I need to apply for family medical leave to accompany her to Medical Treatments certainly you should Express um sympathy to that person you know I'm so sorry to hear this what can I do to help how can the company support you that's all fine but you shouldn't say oh does that run in your family oh what strain does she have because then you're asking for genetic information and employers aren't allowed to do that and a lot of times when I say that managers will respond by saying how dare you tell me I can't express sympathy to my employees you can express sympathy to your employees you can help your employees you can offer support to your employees you cannot ask them about genetic information does it run in your family is where it crosses the line so that's all 11 of the protected characteristics and managers should know what those protected characteristics are so that when things related to that enter into um how people are treated in the workplace and how assignments are dled out the type typ of things that people say to each other so they have a sense of the types of things that are just flat out off limits and it's it's even a little more complicated than that like uh you also can't discriminate on the basis of how people people's opinions on unions you can't discriminate on the basis of whether or not someone has um a family medical leave circumstance on file those things aren't really consider protective characteristics but they are important considerations to know when you're trying to protect your organization against uh discrimination allegations so that's that's a that's I know that's a lot of information something I would encourage you to do after the training is you know you've got your materials that go along with today's session study those protected characteristics know what they are so that when they're introduced in the workplace you can proactively take steps to shut that down so that the liability is mitigated for your organization as well as to ensure that people aren't being disadvantaged in their careers on the basis of things that are legally protected all of which are things that they can't help and or are constitutionally protected so how does this apply when we're hiring um a lot of times managers are given this like you know magic list of illegal interview questions don't ask these questions and there are certainly things you shouldn't ask but when I first started managing people because I moved into HR through operations I was given a list that had about 15 maybe 20 questions on it I was like don't ask these things so we don't get sued and it said like don't ask how old they are but it didn't say don't ask how many years they've had a driver's license or don't ask um how many years they've been in the workplace or things like that and those are all questions that tap into age it would say don't ask what country from but it didn't say don't ask if English is their first language don't ask what language they speak at home those are all national origin questions the real issue there there's no such thing as a list of questions that is sufficient for managers to know everything they need to know to protect the organization better know the protected characteristics don't ask anything related to those topics and if employees start telling you things related to those topics stop them reframe the question because the real issue is that it is unlawful to use protected characteristic information to make employment decisions I didn't just say it's unlawful to ask it's unlawful to use that information and I used to think very very early in my management career because when I first became a manager I hadn't had previous training specific to HR I thought oh if somebody tells me I mean I guess I can use that information no if somebody tells you something related to protective class and then you don't hire them you don't promote them and they accuse you of using that information they don't have to prove you did you have to prove you didn't and that's pretty hard to do especially if it never crossed your mind to do it so the safer option is to avoid getting such information so we all need to know the protected characteristics and we need to keep them out of the hiring process we should never ever ever ask interviewees protected characteristic information in any way shape or form and we should also avoid asking questions that are so open-ended that people are likely to share protected characteristic information you know a lot of people in interviews who are will just say oh tell me about yourself please stop please please please don't ask that that is an invitation for them to just throw all kinds of protected care istic information out on the table and some people are going to do it because it's really what defines them and some people are going to do it because they know that you just open the door to make it really really easy for them to sue you for employment discrimination and that's what they want don't put yourself or your company in that situation so don't say tell me about yourself that's too wide open you know what if I say I like to bake cakes and I have three do I mean how is that going to help you decide whether I can do a job or not it's not that is of no relevance to you and what if I say I'm proud of the fact that I supported three people in my family as they fought XYZ debilitating disease and I a single parent of six children and I'm able to do it with very few absences from work and I'm able to do it because of the support I get from my church family and I go to church here and there well that is like a multi-bay harassment lawsuit looking for a place to happen if you don't hire that person because you'll never prove that you didn't use that information to make your employment decision or if you do prove it it's going to be a long and costly road to getting there so don't put yourself in that situation tell me about why you're interested in working in manufacturing tell me why you chose to leave this large metropolitan area where your last job was to move to this rural area you're going to get to know them that way but you're going to get to know them in the context of the job um don't ask for stuff that you're not going to use to make decisions and certainly don't ever ask for stuff that you can't legally use to make decisions and if they start to give you protected characteristic information stop them say wait a minute let me reframe the question what I'm looking for is and get that question turned around so that it is more focused on information that you really want to use and of course when you do make your hiring decisions document those reasons if they do accuse you of using protective characteristic information then you're going to have to go back and try to prove that you did not so you're going to need to be able to demonstrate why someone was selected over the other and situations aren't looked at in isolation you know you're going to if if that accusation is made the company's going to have to look for you know show patterns so again keep that stuff out and I run into some managers who think that they have to worry about all this stuff up until up through the interview process but then once the employees are hired that all that stuff doesn't matter anymore and that's not true potential liability doesn't end with the interviewing process it is a fact under us law that in the workplace people are to be treated without regard to protected characteristics there are 11 federally characteristics many states have defined additional characteristics as protected as well so you would need to educate yourself about any specific statutes that may apply in the state where you live for example in Louisiana sickle cell trait is protected in California um being a victim of domestic violence or stalking is a protected characteristic and when people aren't treated without regard to proteced characteristic then the result from a legal perspective I'm not talking emotion a legally the result is harassment and discrimination because like I said harassment is a specialized form of dis discrimination and the eeo laws have protections against both so what is discrimination Le and I hear me clearly when I say just because an employee uses the word discrimination does not mean that what the employee is describing is in fact discrimination discrimination is treating people differently on the basis of a protected characteristic you sometimes I'll deal with complaints with clients where the employees my boss is discriminating against me she yelled at me and said that she would fire me if I was late to work again well that might not be polite that might not be the best way to handle employee behavioral issues but it's not unlawful um legally defined discrimination is treating people differently on the basis of a protected characteristic and it applies to all all terms and conditions of employment within the scope of discrimination there are two forms of harassment there is what's called quidd proquo which applies specifically to sexual harassment quid proquo is Latin it means this for that one thing in exchange for the other it is the circumstance of um typically it's supervisory subordinate in almost every situation where a manager would promise or threaten to deny or really give or really deny access to terms and conditions of employment on the basis of sexual um conduct of of of any type you know I'll do this for you if you do this for me if you don't do this for me I'll make sure you don't get what you want type harassment and then there's hostile environment harassment hostile environment harassment can be sexual harassment but it can also be harassment on the basis of any legally protected characteristic um hostile environment harassment is defined as unwelcome comments or conduct which of course conduct is behavior based on any legally protected characteristic that unreasonably interferes with an employees work performance or that creates an intimidating hostile or offensive work environment and your standard of what is offensive your standard of what is intimidating your standard of what is hostile may not be applicable the EOC and the courts use the quote reasonable person standard could a reasonable person find this circumstance to unreasonably interfere with this their work performance could a reasonable person create see this as intimidating see this as hostile or see this as offensive and when that is the case then hostile environment harassment occurs and the and the Equal Employment Opportunity laws prohibit both they prohibit quid proquo harassment and hostile environment harassment we also have to be mindful that um they prohibit retaliation which we'll talk about in a minute but there's also protections against what's called thirdparty harassment someone who may may be the eles they're not the target of the harassment but they have to be exposed to it in order to do their jobs this is harassment of employees who are not they themselves the target of the behavior and it can occur in quidd proquo situations it can occur in hostile environment situations you know in quidd proquo say there's a situation where the manager tells an employee if you sleep with me I'll make sure you get this promotion and that employee gets the promotion the other employee who applied who was equally qualified who either turned down the manager or was not propositioned by the manager who didn't does didn't get the job can ha has experienced third-party harassment they were denied access to an employment opportunity because of quidd proquo harassment that took place between that manager and another employee and the flip side is to true as well say the manager already involved in a sexual relationship with an employee this situation comes along the manager decides not to promote the one he or she is in the relationship with and so promotes the other employee the one who's in the relationship might not be real happy when that happens and can scream that they were denied access to employment because they were in a sexual relationship with the manager and yes that still falls under quidd proquo harassment it does not matter that if the relationship was consensual what is unlawful is in any way shape or form tying the granting or denial of employment benefits to sexual conduct in any way shape or form between a supervisory and uh subordinate employee any supervisor Who's involved in a relationship with someone in their reporting Authority is putting themselves at risk and is putting their companies at risk and I know a lot of companies have policies that say that if you are in that relationship that you should disclose it to the company and that's a good policy but the fact that the company knows about it doesn't alleviate potential liability again what is against the law is tying granting or denial of employment benefits to that type of relationship a lot of the reasons companies want things like that disclosed is to make sure that that manager um isn't in the situation of on his or her own making decisions that impact the path of other people's careers so that's an illustration both of why supervisory subordinate romantic or sexual relationships are dangerous and of thirdparty harassment in such a circumstance hostile environment harassment from a third- party perspective would occur when employees who are not themselves harassed but they have to work in an environment where such harassment is pervasive if you say you have an open floor plan or cubicles and one of the employees in the cubicles is hey baby and everybody you're showing people pictures of their body parts on the phone or making nasty comments to people about their religion or their national origin and maybe he's not talking or she's not talking to this one employee but this employee is sitting there subject to it they have to hear it to do their jobs that's third-party harassment so here's where I would ask again what does without regard mean trick question without regard means without regard these protected characteristic topics basically are ones that flat out do not belong in the work environment and it's not because I'm trying to be sensitive or or politically correct or whatever word you want to use it's because there are laws that specify that that they are not allowed in the work environment yet this continues so much I was working with a group once that literally had been ordered by the EEOC as part of a settlement agreement or to put all of their managers through a harassment prevention training and someone said to me in that class when we had the list of protected characteristics up if we can't talk about those things at work we won't have anything to say and if that's going through your mind right now let me just tell you you are at extraordinary risk of losing not only an individual complaint but a class suit because every person in your work environment is being subject to a legally defined hostile environment and I really don't like the phrase hostile environment because there's plenty of things you know when you hear the word hostile you think yelling screaming you know physical but that's not what it means here hostile environment harassment is simply tied to treating people differently on the basis of protective characteristic you know hey there little lady pretty little thing come up here sit on my lap oh let me touch you when you go by that is all hostile environment harassment as is giving people nicknames about that are associated with protected characteristic you know like uh if if I worked with you and you knew me pretty well you would probably know that heart disease runs in my family I don't have it but my my father died in his early 60s and both of my brothers had multiple heart surgeries before they were 40 years old when I say it runs in my family I mean it runs in my family and so say my co-workers decided to give me a nickname of cardiac arrest it's not disability discrimination I don't have it but it is genetic information discrimination it runs in my family and if I go to work and am called that I am subject to a hostile environment and and I know a lot of times people are like well why would you care well I mean it's something that sometimes it upsets me to to be mindful of that you know you say that to me a day that one of them is in the hospital how am I going t
 react that day and then beyond that say I apply for a job that requires me to climb up ladders you know and work on foone poles or or electrical out and and you're making that employment decision and you're like people call that girl cardiac arrest for a reason why am I going to put her in this safety sensitive job well then I've been denied access to employment for a medical condition that my siblings have that I don't even have that is discrimination so there are reasons the laws are in place and when people get really invested in but I should be able to I I don't know why people get invested in that why you want to put people down on things that they have no control over and or are constitutionally protected but you can't there are laws that say you can't they've been on the books for a very long time the most recent of these laws is the genetic information non-discrimination act and it has been in effect since n since 2008 and it was signed into law several years before that um so I also mentioned that retaliation is prohibited the Equal Employment Opportunity laws they all have a no retaliation Clause pretty much every employment law even if it's not related to eeo have a no retaliation Clause sometimes the equivalent would be referred to as a whistleblower cause but basically you can't take a negative action toward an employee as a result of exercising a right that is protected under the law you know if your employee decides to contact OSHA and tell them that your work environment is not safe whether it's true or not you can't retaliate against them the same applies if they decide to call the EEOC and say that they are being discriminated against on the basis of one or more protected characteristics if they file a complaint using your internal complaint procedure because retaliation doesn't just have to apply to a statute if you have told me this is what you should do if you feel there is a problem and I do it you can't that is a protected activity you can't retaliate against me for it and retaliation involves three elements it's a protected activity I file a complaint it's an adverse employment action you fail to promote me you demote me you put me on a worse schedule you changed me to another location that doubles my commute you pick on me so that my co-workers shun me and think I'm a cattl I mean the list could go on because an adverse employment action since 2006 has been defined as anything that would negatively impact terms and conditions of employment and then of course a causal connection that the cause of that adverse action was the protected activity like if I file a complaint with the EEOC the day after you've caught me in bezeling and you fire me because I am bezzel that's not retaliation you didn't fire me because I called the EEOC but you also can't create pretext and something that comes up after the adverse action isn't going to protect you against the allegation so when I say this is complicated I mean it it's it's pretty complicated and so some some key terms that that we all need to know as supervisors or as HR professionals two of them we've already touched on that reasonable person standard it's not does Mary find this harassing but would a could a reasonable person perceive this to be and should have known we've talked about and I've been in a suit when as a manager um because of something employees did um I've seen a lawsuit that had allegations of negligent hiring negligent retention um practices and the allegation is that you should have known that this person's past was an indicator that the individual could pose a risk to others in the workplace and and it you have to be able to show what decisions you made to try to show that they weren't that you weren't negligent that you didn't have any way of knowing that or those situations where it's you know most workplaces have somebody that somebody in HR is walking around holding their breath just waiting to get served a lawsuit because they're always touching people when they talk to them or making little comments that they think are cute that are across the line and those are the things that should have known bite you with because if you knew it was happening and you didn't stop it that is much worse than finding out it happened and putting a stop to it immediately it's also important to know we're talking about civil law here I mean certainly workplace harassment is uh situ situations could cross the line into criminal situations but most of the circumstances we deal with in the workplace are civil law and intent doesn't matter you know it's without regard means without regard I just meant it as a joke doesn't mean it's okay if there's a law that says it can't be in the workplace period in the story but but but you can but but but all day long intent doesn't matter and and I've I've done a number of internal investigations both as a a within my own organization uh places where I had worked in the past before I had a small business of my own as well as for clients and I can't tell you how many times the manager will say um that the manager will say things like well it was just a joke I was just kidding I thought it was funny I thought it was cute um I I I it doesn't matter the issue is if it happened or not um and and let go of it I mean if it doesn't mean something to you just stop doing it intent doesn't matter if it happened or not it was just a joke or I thought it was cute is never a defense when there's a law that says without regard and you also have to keep into consideration that burden of proof the on who to what standard um you know it's it's not up to the employee who accuses you of proving that it happened it is up to the employer to prove that it didn't and if you work with an HR person who's always like where's the documentation did you write it down didn't happen if it's not written down and the employee didn't sign off on it that's part of why they're asking for that because when you're saying oh no I didn't fire this person because they called the eooc I fired them because their performance is horrible and then HR goes and opens her file and they see that performance of that valuation and it says perfect perfect perfect perfect if it's not written down it didn't happen that performance evaluation that doesn't document what you are now claiming or performance problems is basically evidence for the employee that you had no reason to take that action so um I know it's a lot to think about and I'm going to give you a little more to think about talk about how commonly this occurs does this stuff really happen yes absolutely harassment and discrimination do occur in the modern workplace sometimes it's intentional sometimes it's unintentional but the reality is is that it doesn't matter if it was intentional or not and it's also true that people sometimes file false complaints I know it I've met some of them sometimes you know what's a false complaint really was just a misunderstanding sometimes it's I'm I caught this company doing letting something happen they shouldn't let happen and I'm goingon to get paid you know it's sometimes it's very malicious but the reality is that if the workplace is truly Beyond reproach the person with malicious intent is not likely to be able to come up with something that's going to stick that they're going to succeed with but the harsh reality is that most companies have what they think or just ignore our so-called little things that occur that end up becoming building that case that helps create a situation where it seems more likely than not that the accusation the person has made has stuck so basically if there's no ammunition that person can't come after you or at least that person doesn't have a chance to be successful so you want to make sure that without regard applies in your work environment so how common are discrimination charges these are um numbers from fiscal year 2017 the last time I checked the 2018 numbers weren't out yet because I guess because of the shutdown um they may be available soon when they are available or if they're there now they would be on the eeoc.gov website I have seen some preliminary numbers for sexual harassment complaints a charges filed in 2018 and I can tell you they spiked uh very significantly in 2018 but these are the approximate percentages by type of the charges uh for that year and of course these percentages add up to more to more than 100% because a single charge can be based on can have more than one base you know I if if if you're well you know we don't want any little ladies named Cardiac Arrest that's sex discrimination and genetic information discrimination ation and a single charge can have multiple and retaliation doesn't just apply to the person who filed the complaint because of course when a complaint is raised that might have policy procedure law implications the next step is to um the next step is totally forgot what I was saying the next the next step um once somebody files that is to conduct an internal investigation and during the course of that internal investigation someone with the company or a third party is going to end up interviewing Witnesses and Witnesses anyone who participates or assists within an investigation is also protected against retaliation and so they can charge as well um so back in um before the end of the year before the end of 2018 the EEOC published a news release that had preliminary um sexual harassment specific stats in it because of course there's a lot of attention on sexual harassment now in the age of me too and times's up with so much media attention focused on very high-profile sexual harassment cases I felt that it was going to lead to an increase and that did come to to pass um the the government's fiscal year federal government run September through October and for the fiscal year ending October 2018 there was a 12% increase in charges that include sexual harassment as a base over the previous year and even more significantly than that the stats had been almost constant no statistically significant difference for a decade and last year with all this attention focused on this topic there was a 12% Spike so if there um people are people are not waiting to file complaints stuff that people would have put up with before they're not putting up with anymore and of course you know people who are looking to make a quick Buck may be coming faster and faster too time will tell if that is the case but also during the last fiscal year the EEOC ended up recovering meaning ordering employers to pay around $70 million out to people who experience sexual harassment in the workplace that's through both administrative enforcement which is investigating you um as an individual organization or they also have the option to either file suit against your company in federal court on behalf of the person who complained or to seek out a class if multiple employees were affected and vied class action suit in federal um and the year before the total was 47.5 Million 47.5 to 70 million that is a big big big difference there weren't that many more settled um and during that year that they also filed 66 harassment lawsuits 41 of which included allegations of sexual harassment so there was more than a 50% increase of the EEOC filing lawsuits alleging sexual harassment so these stats are all separate from the fact that once the EEOC is done with you the employee can go after you in court in your Geographic area and these numbers also don't include legal fees so protection and prevention is key um so some key facts and outcomes we're back to that fiscal year 2017 now during that time frame the EOC resolved over 999,000 charges handled over well over half a million phone calls over 150,"000 inquiries in person in their field offices and secured over 484 million dollars for victims of discrimination and harassment in the workplace um filed 184 Merit lawsuits 124 on behalf of individuals the rest class um and they when the EEOC goes to court the EEOC wins they they had a favorable result in 91% of the cases that were heard through the courts that year and they're very focused on reducing the charge workload they're working on not dragging this stuff out faster investigation really prioritizing F filing in court if it makes sense to do so and also improving their digital systems which improves their efficiency as well so if you've ever thought this stuff doesn't happen yeah yeah it does um they're very costly $48 million in fisal year 2017 the spike I expect for 2018 um includes like I said it it it's only mone's ordered through EEOC but it's only the beginning it doesn't include legal fees it doesn't include action beyond the EEOC and we'll just sort of move toward wrapping up with a a a little quiz and here's a hint the answers are all false these are common misperceptions these are all things that I have either seen in my work or been asked in classes um if a person doesn't complain about being sexually harassed a company cannot be held legally responsible that is a big misconception I know your policy probably says if you feel you've been harassed or discriminated you should tell your supervisor tell HR tell this other person well sure it does but if they fail to do that it doesn't mean that it didn't happen the liability is still there um as a manager if you don't know an employee is being harassed you cannot beheld legally responsible yes you can should have known if you were paying attention to what was going on would you have been aware of what was going on in your work environment that's basically how it plays out and employees will go pretty hard um or try pretty hard to hide stuff from managers you know we've got to be diligent in managing that that work environment being mindful of what's going on in the work environment the next false statement if someone participates in offensive Behavior the person cannot claim that he or she was harassed um that is not true just because you have done something you shouldn't doesn't mean that people have a blank check to do things that they shouldn't to you this next one there's case law on this it's legal for a manager to promise an employee a promotion in exchange for sex if the employe is really going to get the promotion anyway no that is not true with quidd proquo a single incident of a threat of tying granting or denial of employment benefits to sex in any way shape or form is sufficient for liability period um next false statement an employer can't be held liable for the actions of a supervisory employee acting beyond the scope of his or her Authority yes the company can they tell you not to do something as a manager and you do it anyway you're responsible for your own actions but the company still has liability too because they've put you in a position of being a manager in that organization and the reality is that employers are always responsible for the acts of their agents and their supervisory employees with respect to legally defined workplace harassment sexual or otherwise regardless of whether the specific acts completed were authorized or even forbidden by the employer and whether the employer knew or should have known of their occurrence so what does that mean in plain English if as a manager you engage in sexually harassing Behavior or other types of workplace harassment the company is still viable even if they have a policy prohibiting it and even if upper management had no clue not even should have known no clue because you're in that position companies can't afford to keep managers around who insist on engaging in harassing Behavior or refuse to stop harassing behavior and with quid proquo when there truly is a proven quid pro quo claim you know it really did Le to that tangible employment outcome literally there is no way to mitigate that the the court uses strip liability standard there if it didn't lead to a tangible outcome the employer would still be liable unless they could prove both that they truly did exercise care to correct and prevent and remedy the situation and that the employee unreasonably complained to management or avoid harm and you know those I've already mentioned about the threat of economic loss what a what a big deal that is there's just no there's no room in the modern world for managers to attempt to tie employment benefits to sex with hostile environment and liability employers are liable if they knew or should have known about the harassment and failed to take corrective action and anyone can create a hostile environment it can be your supervisors your employees even vendors working at your location could create a hostile environment and again just to make sure that's really pinpoint focused in your mind what it should have known look like you know employer may have been expected to know about the hostile environment if there was a complaint to management and when the person complains they don't have to use the word harassing they don't have to say I feel that I'm being harassed it can be the person who's in here working on our copy machine called me a and then gives you a racial epath that well that's that's harassment don't say well they don't work for me just go over there and do your job and ignore it that's you knowing there's harassment and telling the person that they have to put up with it exacerbated liability at that point um it's also look if management doesn't have a policy against harassment if your company doesn't have a policy you need to get one and if you have one you need to ensure that it is effectively and frequently communicated to employees at all levels it is a best practice to do workplace harassment training with managers and employees every two years and to redistribute the policies at that time and have them sign off on them and put those updated sign offs in their files and then of course if it's something that everybody kind of knows about so as a manager you need to put a stop to harassment get HR involved um when a complaint is made to you if you see or hear about behavior that may be offensive to others or that you know represents sexual harassment or other forms of workplace harassment if you should be aware if you yourself engage in harassing Behavior if you delay in taking AC you know problems don't go away if we ignore them um so if you delay or if you fail to take action or or if you take retaliatory action towards someone who filed a complaint or participated in an investigation so there's a lot of liability how do you de there's a lot of ways liability is created prevention is the best defense stop it if there's things going on that shouldn't stop them if an adverse action related a quid proquo took place there is no defense if the existence of a hostile environment is established that employer liability liability is also going to be automatic unless the employer took action to prevent and remedy the harassment which would include starting that internal investigation within 24 to 48 hours of finding out that there may be a problem and if the situation warrants potentially separating people or removing um not the person who complained but others from the work people who may be doing things they shouldn't from the work environment pending the investigation and of course if the employee failed to act reasonably to avoid the harassment so this is a very complicated area of compliance follow your company's complaint procedure whatever it is if you don't have a clear one talk to your HR team or owners managers you know depending on the size of your company there needs to be a procedure um and and and managers shouldn't try to investigate their own employee someone who is not in their direct supervisory Authority who knows employment law should do that managers are sometimes involved in investigations but generally um not you know managers have to listen to complaint subjectively make sure the procedure is implemented and again if you don't have one talk to your leadership about getting that put on your to-do list maybe bring in legal counsel to assist you with that um immediately report complaints related to policy procedure law violations but let HR take the lead and of course your your um um want to make sure there's no there's no retaliation taken I know that is a lot of information""",,,,,,,,

chair no good morning everybody I'm representative Molly Burke of Brattleboro chair of the house sexual harassment prevention panel and I'm here with members of the panel and we are going to be discussing a few items this morning uh first on the agenda is to talk about a bill that was submitted that we had submitted last year that um oh sorry no I'm sorry we're going to be discussing a proposal to amend house rules to change the confidentiality provision to include sharing information between the ethics panel discrimination prevention panel and sexual harassment prevention panel and we had had questions about what that meant and I think that Maggie Fen our attorney will um talk about this yes so the question that was raised the last time that we disc discuss this was whether there was any possibility when you combine two of the proposed changes one that the ethics panel will be able to consult with the this panel sexual harassment prevention panel and the Discrimination prevention panel about matters that involve a combination of panels if you combine that change with the change that the ethics panel May issue a public statement once an Ethics panel matter is generally known to the public to clear up misconceptions and explain their procedure whether there's any possibility that communication with this panel could be disclosed to the public meaning imagine the ethics panel consulted with this panel and then as a part of their public statement uh to the um press or whatever said well here's our procedure we have a fair hearing uh we discussed this with the sexual harassment prevention panel and the respondent is entitled to due process so I think that was the concern that so the involvement of this panel at all could end up before the public so I raised that with Betsy an and her her response was that they don't really consider any discussion with any other panel to be a a part of their procedure for the purposes of that disclosure I mean her the sense of our communication was that that's not what they're intending to do and she didn't think that that would really be proper anyway um but that was not how they envisioned their procedure to be at all I think she really does see these as separate Provisions um so that is the response that I got and I guess the question before us is whether we we just have to agree to this I mean I'm I'm trying to figure out what we're supposed to do about this we're supposed to agree as a panel that we will agree with with their proposal the epics panel procedurally I think if there is disagreement then that would go to representative L and his and the change to the house rules I can appreciate the intent and I can appreciate um that we don't Envision this ever happening certainly but do we need the guard rail in place anyway some you know a brief sentence that states in a public statement um we would not disclose collaboration with other panels something to that effect yeah that yes and I I wish Betsy's response had been firmer you know that absolutely no this but no she said I don't think it would be proper it wouldn't be the intent uh you know I just we're still on a slipp slow here yeah would take one person saying we're in communication with the sexual harassment battle to a press release and suddenly everybody realizes that theic's concern is a har concern now ding ding ding ding the bells go off that's yeah so I don't know if we need to guard Lear not um I on the side of caution I interrup you finished y I'm finished so I'm going use the word be conservative who glad I've served this long waiting for that I I think we should air on the side of caution and I would agree just a statement about says they can make the public statement and like you said no disclosure of communication with any other could be F about and then would be yeah that look amazing so we can report this to Martin and then we'll that will become part of the I think the discussion I think the next step is a discussion with representative Lon that is what the cler of the house indicated to me okay so um do we need to have that discussion as a panel should we um invite representative L to a meeting with us or can we just convey that to him what what do you think would be the proper way to go about this um I will report back to Betsy Anne and let her know this the a summary of what we talked about today and the lingering concerns okay and see what she has to say about a resolution okay great okay so you will take care of that I will great thank you very much and if we have to have another meeting we can schedu it okay great all right so the the second one was the um just to say that the representative bus presented a bill which is age 429 and it was this pretty much the same bill that we um we submitted last year in response to the fact that we realized that we had no jurisdiction over Statewide elected officials and that was a gap in our policy so that bill is meant to address that it's been submitted to house General it's just there so there's nothing happening I'm just want to that uh and I haven't talked to the chair whether that's CH or go I think oh go makes sense General said to house General last year but I can look that up yeah can look it up right now we have our fingertips well I think that's what I saw when I looked it up that it's General yeah okay okay I my fingertips but you're faster I already have the screen okay so then is there any other business that we need to discuss today okay so motion to adjourn second we need a second I'll second

considering the millions of workers that exist in the US and what's even more staggering is even when someone does speak up they don't see any real change or Justice well guys this creates an additional barrier to harassment prevention how can you prevent harassment if those people speak up about it don't see the benefit of speaking up I understand the fear and isolation that can come from

no business in our businesses they are without question completely unacceptable there has been a seismic shift in tolerance levels for harassment what used to be okay isn't anymore and if you harass or assault a colleague an employee a boss or a business contact today your job will be in Jeopardy people feel empowered which is good but some will take advantage which is not good and that's another reason why it's so important to take these complaints seriously behavior that was acceptable just 20 years ago is no longer tolerated victims are empowered to speak up and many no longer feel silenced by shame or fear what does me too mean to you please pause the video for a moment and share your thoughts in the com comment section the me too movement has empowered victims women were once silenced by shame of reporting but that isn't as successful as it once was belief in women's experiences has grown and the me too movement has played a significant role in demonstrating the validity of these shared experiences anti-harassment legislation doesn't just apply to employees and employer may be held liable for harassment by non-employees as well such as a customer's harassment of an employee if the employer knew or should have known of the harassment had the power to control the conduct of the non-employee and Fa to take prompt corrective action anyone who comes into the workplace or who you associate with due to your work duties can create hostile work environment the mail delivery person the copy machine repair person a customer or a client can all Impact an employes ability to do their job an employer can also be held strictly liable for the acts of its supervisors who engage in harassment supervisors and managers can be sued personally for harassment with potential criminal liability for individuals and the stat ude of limitations for sexual assault has been extended to 10 years good news is when we all do our part independently our Collective effort result in a much easier much safer more respectful and more equal workplace for all of us okay so let's start by defining what workplace harassment is under California law F Fair Employment and Housing Act harassment is unwelcome conduct based on a legally protected characteristic that creates a hostile intimidating or offensive work environment or negatively affects employment a common question that I am often asked about harassment is what is the standard how do I know if I've crossed the line and I like to tell people to use the mom test or the daughter test let me explain think of a person that you feel protective of and imagine that person experiencing the conduct that you have heard witnessed or been accused of conducting if it's not appropriate for your mom or your daughter to experience that conduct then it's not appropriate for the employee it is the duty of a manager especially to act if they become aware of harassment and how you act depends on the circumstances but it will likely involve stopping the conduct and if it's severe reporting it to Human Resources under California law employees are protected from discrimination and harassment based on specific legally recognized characteristics in other words it's illegal to treat employees unfairly or engage in conduct that targets them on the basis of of personal traits such as race color national origin sex gender identity gender expression sexual orientation pregnancy childbirth or related medical conditions religion or religious beliefs disability physical or mental age 40 years and older genetic information marital status military or veteran status ancestry citizenship or immigration status right this means that any adverse action or inappropriate behavior directed at employees because of these protected characteristics are illegal as a result employers must not only avoid overt discrimination like firing or demoting someone because of their race gender or religion they have to also avoid more subtle forms of bias like excluding employees from opportunities or creating a hostile work environment based on these traits the law is clear any action that undermines an employees rights due to these protected characteristics is unlawful in other words if an employee is treated unfairly or subjected to negative behaviors simply because of characteristics such as race gender age or other legally protected traits the law provides them with specific steps they can take to seek Justice this protection is key to helping ensure that everyone is working in an environment that is respectful and inclusive and the protections for these personal traits underscores that all employees are entitled to work in an environment where decisions are based solely on Merit and performance those things that they achieve not on personal characteristics like ethnic gender or religion any adverse action whether it's a reprimand isolation or even subtle forms of bias when it's based on these factors it's not only unethical it's also illegal under current employment laws if you want to know more about subtle signs of workplace harassment be sure to watch my video workplace retaliation explained how timing proves it and the legal test to know because it breaks down exactly how retaliation claims work the crucial role timing plays and the legal standard that courts use to evaluate evidence harassment is any unwelcome Behavior based on race color religion sex national origin age disability or genetic information there are two types of workplace harassment the first type is sexual harassment or quidd proquo harassment this occurs when job benefits like promotions or favorable work assignments are directly linked to an employees acceptance or rejection of unwelcome behavior for example if a supervisor implies that an employes career advancement depends on the employees willingness to tolerate inappropriate comments hostile work environment is another form of harassment which involves behavior that is pervasive or severe enough to create an intimidating abusive or offensive work atmosphere it may not involve a specific quidd proquo exchange still undermines an employees dignity and that employes ability to perform their job effectively examples of this would include a manager who offers a raise in exchange for a date also a coworker who is repeatedly more than once making inappropriate sexual jokes also any physical touching or gestures or comments that are unwanted and unwelcome by the employee who is receiving them harassment is not just about opposite Sexes people of the same sex can harass each other based on gender anti-harassment legislation applies to everyone from the CEO to line employees and harassment in the workplace is prohibited even if the perpetrator is not an employee job related harassment is prohibited even if it occurs away from the work site for example harassment would be prohibited during a business trip or at a client's site it's also important to understand what harassment is not for example asking someone out on a date or twice making an offensive joke not based on an individual's protected characteristics or making an isolated sexually offensive joke these scenarios can generate legal claims that are costly to defend but they do not meet the standard for actionable harassment under federal law but a request for a date could become harassment if the speaker refuses to take no for an answer and repeats the behavior the behavior pervasive or severe this is why it's so important to stop the behavior before before it repeatedly occurs and qualifies as harassment employees should also be mindful that emails text messages and social media could become tools for harassment managers accepting or soliciting requests to or from subordinates to be friends on social media is problematic because the private information shared on those platforms may impact the relationship at work emails and social media posts may be forwarded or misdirected increasing their reach and potential Fallout it's important to remember that emails continue to exist even after employees delete them employees May perceive their social media activity as off-duty conduct but if it involves interactions with co-workers and violates an employers anti-discrimination and harassment policies it can be treated as a workplace issue in addition activity on employer-owned computers such as visiting in appropriate websites can be monitored and easily traceable it's important to consider all of these points before you post on social media or send an email check out my video on Twitter's layoff Debo which unfolded right after Elon Musk purchased the company and rebranded it as X the video takes a closer look at how systemic harassment ties into gender discrimination and offers a real life look at workplace harassment so what would you do if you overheard a co-worker making an inappropriate comment about another employees appearance what do you think would be the best way to handle it please pause the video take a moment to think about it and then share your response in the comment section harassment can also show up in verbal and physical forms for example name calling insults or offensive jokes to others not to mention yelling aggressive behaviors the types of conduct that would intimidate an employee harassment can also be demonstrated through physical intimidation like blocking someone's movement or gestures that cause discomfort this type of conduct is illegal and it can have serious consequences on an employees mental and emotional well-being not to mention the impact that it can have if you'd like to learn more about harassment prevention and better understand the legal standards required to prove harassment check out my video she had five pages of evidence but it wasn't enough it's a real life case study that clearly shows what's needed and often times what is missing to meet the legal standard for harassment visual harassment can be anything that is visible to another worker like offensive posters cartoons drawings that are displayed at work or the act of sending inappropriate messages or suggestive emails or text messages retaliation and bullying are another form of harassment and the behaviors are closely linked together because when an employee is subjected to bullying it's often triggered by retaliatory actions which is why these issues are typically linked and addressed together retaliation occurs when an employer takes an adverse action or a negative action really against an employee for reporting harassment or participating in an investigation this not only harms the individual employee but also discourages others from coming forward ultimately creating a work Culture of Fear and silence a examples of retaliation include being demoted or fired after filing a complaint a demotion salary reduction or unfounded and illegitimate disciplinary actions having work hours cut for speaking up about misconduct or even termination retaliation can also be intentionally covering up retaliatory conduct it's important to know that the law protects employees from retaliation and that helps make sure that when employees do have the courage to speak up or to help out in an investigation that they're not going to be punished for their efforts to promote a safe and respectful work environment if you want to know more about retaliation at work check out my video workplace retaliation it covers the legal case between the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center versus thear and the retaliation efforts that were taken by the employer in that case and what the court decided as a result of the employer actions California law mandates that employers not only have a harassment complaint process in place but also ensure that it's transparent it's accessible and well documented for every employee and this requirement means that the complaint process details step by-step instructions on how employees can report harassment including who to contact and what information is needed this requirement means that the complaint process must include confidentiality and safety measures that protect the identity of those reporting the harassment by maintaining confidentiality throughout the complaint process the complaint process also has to include protection against retaliation it has to clearly state that retaliation against anyone who reports harassment is strictly prohibited and outline how such retaliation will be addressed this requirement means that the complaint process must include regular communication and training employers are required to actively inform and train employees on the complaint process making sure that everyone understands their rights and the procedures available for filing a complaint the complaint process must also include a timely response it has to include guidelines on how promptly investigations will begin and how outcomes will be communicated to those involved ultimately This legal requirement is designed to foster a respectful safe and inclusive work environment that encourages employees to come forward with concerns without fear and ensuring that any issues are handled Timely so what should you do if you experience or witness harassment at work let's talk about the steps you should take the first step is to document what has happened write down the date time and location what happened how it made you feel and save any relevant email messages or evidence if you're comfortable consider confronting the harasser describe the behavior that bothers you why it's a problem how you feel and and how it affects your environment tell the harasser that the harassing conduct must stop and explain how you would prefer the situation be handled inform the harasser that if the harassing Behavior continues you will complain to management the next step is to report what you have seen or experienced to human resources or management managers and supervisors are held to a higher standard than non supervisory employees when it comes to harassment prevention they are required to take immediate action if they witness or become aware of harassment if you are a coworker who learns about harassment listen and if the harassed person is comfortable suggest that he or she confront the alleged harasser offer to practice the confrontation and suggest supportive feedback encourage the person to report the harassment to the person or Department that the harassment policy designates to receive these types of complaints and you should also report it yourself if you are the alleged harasser that is you are the person who's being confronted about your own behavior the first thing to do is to listen try not to be defensive keep an open mind even if you disagree stop the offending Behavior if possible express your willingness to address the situation and if you cannot stop the behavior tell your supervisor speak with management or human resources it's important to remember that if you are the alleged harasser you need to maintain a normal working relationship with the person who is accusing you or confronting you about harassment don't retaliate against the employee for his complaint or her concerns cooperate with them tell them the truth in the investigation and don't spread rumors about the situation so always remember the mom test or the daughter test it is such a good rule of thumb to live by in the workplace if the conduct is not appropriate for your mom or your daughter to experience it's not likely that it's appropriate for a coworker you also want to be sure and follow your employer's internal reporting procedures if you're reporting internally doesn't resolve the issue external agencies can also help One external agency that supports employees in claims of harassment is the California civil rights Department you can file a formal complaint by going to the website shown on the screen and employees have 3 years to file a harassment claim with the California civil rights Department it is illegal for an employer to retaliate against you for filing a complaint if you face retaliation you have rights and legal protections if you are interested in a real life case about workplace harassment in California check out my video workplace mobbing and retaliation in medicine in that case the employee followed the internal procedures for filing a harassment complaint but when she didn't get a resolution she took the next step she filed a complaint with the Civil Rights civil Department in California and in the end she got Justice it's a powerful example of how knowing your rights and taking action matters this training emphasizes the importance of both preventing harassment and maintaining a safe workplace prevention is truly essential for a harassment free environment if you are an employee speak up if you witness inappropriate behavior and support your co-workers who experience harassment and take action early to stop harassment from spreading if you are an employer enforce clear anti-harassment policies provide regular training and encourage reporting take all complaints seriously and investigate them promptly for a real life case about how workplace harassment investigations can go wrong

pmRmONMaLLA,presentationsPPT Sexual Harassment Prevention Training for Employees,2025-03-11T15:10:00Z,UCHKujAfeqlxDH9xJELX-H9w,sexual harassment prevention,IN,0,6,0,,good morning this is Katie Edgar the Director of Human Resources at Watermill Express I am here just to do a quick review of our harassment training we do a formal harassment training once a year we recently implemented a new software to get this done and that will not be ready for the next month or two so this presentation is just to bridge that Gap uh so all employees whether they're newly hired or it has been a year since our last conversation we want everybody to know that um you know what to do in those situations if they arise and also know that they are not expected to put up with any of this Behavior the agenda for what we'll talk about um what is sexual harassment why is it important to talk about we'll discuss our policy and procedure regarding it and also your responsibilities as an employee uh when these situations arise so what is sexual harassment this includes unwelcome sexual advances requests for sexual favors or any other type of verbal written electronic or physical conduct of a sexual nature that affects an individual's employment unreasonably interferes with his or her work performance or creates an intimidating hostile or offensive work environment So This falls into two categories that will dive into deeper we have quid proquo which means this for that and hostile work environment so quid pro quo is tangible employment actions against the victim and it involves monetary loss or change of job so an example of this type of sexual harassment is Yeet receives a smaller performance-based pay increase than other employees with similar similar performance because she refused to go on a date with her supervisor so this is when your manager or another employee says or even doesn't say but is noticeably treating you differently because of your rejection to engage in this type of behavior so that is what is called quidd Pro clo the other form is hostile work environment this is when speech or conduct that is and or pervasive enough to create an abusive or hostile work environment for an example Max is learing at or intentionally brushing against Vanessa so the thing to pay attention to here is the severe or pervasive uh pervasive means ongoing repeat repeated type of behavior if you know we all make mistakes we might say something that um comes off wrong and you know we can apologize and and never say that type of thing again that is still not okay but it doesn't quite cross into a hostile work environment situation until it's severe there's certain things that you just cannot say at work and even if you say it once if it's severe then it crosses into this line pervasive is maybe something that isn't severe but happens regularly and makes you feel uncomfortable for example um like giving hugs let's say you have a manager that routinely likes to give hugs to employees you're not comfortable with it and every day that person is asking for a hug and it's making you feel uncomfortable when it gets to the point that you can't do your job um that is really this hostile work environment we want to know about these situations well before it gets to that point if you bring a situation to us and you say hey this happened once um that's great that's all part of the investigation that we'll talk about later we want to know all that information please do not wait until you think something is severe or pervasive to bring it to our attention the other thing to remember is there might be other situations going on that you're not aware of um we do try to keep this as confidential as possible so as far as you know we might be getting similar complaints from other employees that also don't reach that severe or pervasive measurement but if it's happening to multiple employees that's a different story and we need to know so whenever something doesn't feel right it's making you uncomfortable or you see that it's making other people uncomfortable that's a sign that you really need to to bring it forward and we'll talk about that process in addition to what we just talked about um the speech and conduct hostile work environment covers explicit or suggestive items that are emailed texted electronically provided or displayed in the workplace that interfere with your job performance or creates an abusive or hostile work environment situation so the example here is you know sending text messages and instant messages to co-workers that are inappropriate it doesn't have to be verbal it doesn't have to be physical touch if you're making people feel uncomfortable that is the problem that we're focusing on so who can commit sexual harassment this is not limited to just employees and managers anybody in the company can commit sexual harassment if it's another employee another co-worker if it's your manager um a director you know all the way up to the senior officers of the company nobody is exempt from these expectations everybody needs to be treated with respect and everybody needs to be treating others with the same respect it also includes customers or vendors if you are going to a Watermill unit and you notice that there's always a customer there waiting for you and they make you feel uncomfortable we need to know about that as well or if you're at the office and you have a vendor that repeatedly comes in and makes inappropriate comments let us know you are not expected to Toler that type of behavior and another thing to point out is that it's not always a member of the opposite sex it can be women complaining about other women it can be men complaining about men it does not have to be the opposite sex it can be any combination of genders in order for it to qualify as uh sexual harassment um and who can be a victim any individual targeted by the statements or even by standard so just because you don't necessarily find something offensive maybe in the office there's jokes that are commonly told if it's making other people feel uncomfortable it's still an issue those bystanders even if the joke isn't being told directly to that employee if they overhear it that's still sexual harassment if they feel uncomfortable we just don't want any type of that in the workplace so so remember that even if you're not intentionally trying to offend somebody or you're being very selective with who you make these jokes to if other people are witnessing it they can still be victims so why is it important that we have these conversations to prevent this type of behavior sexual harassment harms all of us it changes our um environment and the culture that we have created with this company the most important part of our corporate values is to ensure that all employees are treated with respect and dignity um I won't go into all the details of how having that negative culture can affect um the organization and the morale of all the employees but it can do significant harm across the entire Market it's not always just one employee that is going to be feeling uncomfortable engaging in condoning or not reporting sexual harassment is in direct conflict with our values and then lastly we always want to remain compliant there are uh federal and state laws surrounding sexual harassment so we don't want to cross into that but more importantly we want to make sure that our employees feel comfortable and can get the work done in their day that they're being brought here to do so when it comes to Watermill Express I want to touch on a few other uh areas that are not explicitly sexual harassment but other areas that uh can make people feel very uncomfortable and that are protected by law include race religion religious Creed color national origin ancestry physical disability mental disability medical condition genetic information marital status sex productive Health decision-making gender gender identity gender expression age military status veteran status uniformed service member status sexual orientation transgender identity uh citizenship status pregnancy and any other consideration made unlawful by federal state or local laws are strictly prohibited so if you know we're talking about sexual harassment today but this includes all types of harassment bottom line we want to make sure people feel comfortable coming to work every day and they are not expected to tolerate any type of this discrimination or harassment type of behavior so if you feel like sexual harassment is taking place or any type of harassment based on any of these categories um we need to be reporting it right away so that's the next section here if an employee believes they have been subject to harassment or have seen harassment take place they must immediately report to their manager or HR we will investigate the situation and collect evidence to the extent possible confidentiality will be protected against unnecessary disclosure the company will take appropriate remedial corrective action up to an including termination so it's a process once we get a complaint Us in the HR department we will start an invest investigation figure out if other employees are being affected this way figure out how severe and pervasive the situation is and um part of your responsibility is to assist with that investigation if we call you or call you into a meeting and ask you questions by Nature this is very uncomfortable uh but it's important that you're honest with us and transparent if we don't hear about the problems there's no way that we can fix it and again there might be situations that are happening to some employees but not all and if you're witnessing that type of behavior we need to know about it to collaborate other stories so even if you're not directly affected by the harassment maybe you're a bystander and you've witnessed it we need you to participate in the investigation so we can do our job as a company to protect all the employees in a nutshell your responsibilities are to know and comply with our policy and procedure obviously everything we've talked about just make sure that you are paying attention to your surroundings the type of language and behavior that might be acceptable outside of work could be very unacceptable at the workplace so know your surroundings know that you're here to do work we're not here to um you know become best friends and make inappropriate jokes with people it's a workplace your other responsibility report incidents that you experience directly or witness um and this includes the last step here supporting victims some employees are very uncomfortable talking about this help them out bring it to our attention so they are not put on the spot we will call them in and ask the same um investigation questions that we would have if they would have brought it to us but hearing it from you might start the process where they would have been uncomfortable bringing it to us and then cooperate cooperate with investigations if we don't hear your stories if we don't hear what's really going on it's hard for us to hold people accountable we need you to tell us what you're experiencing good or bad um you know saying you don't want to participate it's not your area to be concerned about it is your area because it's your market and your co-workers are being affected so please help us with the investigations so in summary sexual harassment is unwelcome sexual advances requests for sexual favors and other verbal written electronic or physical conduct of a sexual nature that affects an individual's employment unreasonably interferes with his or her work performance or creates an intimidating hostile or offensive work environment the two forms we discussed quid proquo and hostile work environment it is important to prevent sexual harassment in our workplace because it does harm us all it conflicts with our corporate value that all employees are treated with respect and dignity we do not care if it's quidd pro quo or hostile work environment that's for us to figure out through the investigation you just need to bring us the information and let us do the investigation sexual harassment is illegal under federal and state laws your responsibilities regarding prevention of sexual harassment are to know and comply with our policy and procedure report incidents that you experience directly or witness cooperate with our investigations and support the victims in summary as our contact information here um your primary contact can always be your manager um if you are uncomfortable talking to your manager reach out to us in HR directly um my name Katie Edgar Director of Human Resources here is my phone number and my email we also have a human resource assistant Amanda you can contact her with the same requests we all work as a team if you report something to your manager they know to bring that to us immediately so it's a matter of making you feel comfortable however you want to get the company this information we will take it so contact your manager contact HR um and support those that are reporting incidents and support the investigation that will follow if you have any questions about any of this content feel free to reach out to us and human resources or your manager directly and we can provide additional resources and then just remember that we will have that formal harassment training within the next couple months thank you for your time have a good day

p9d1nkS0z8U,Sexual Harassment Prevention A Legal Duty Every HR Leader Must Understand with Chantal Cross,2025-03-06T05:00:49Z,UCH_nBxhlZJGPbXaFniqzJjw,sexual harassment prevention,GB,5,172,0,,"there was a report done by McKenzie um that said ensuring gender equality in in the UK has the potential to add 150 billion pounds to business as usual in terms of the GDP forecasts in in 2025 um it makes good business sense because it's all about reducing turnover you're going to have increased absenteeism if people are being effectively bullied or harassed at [Music] work hello and welcome to an episode of The Plum pod where we talk about all things HR and mental health I'm your host Georgia and founder of access HR in today's episode I'm joined by Chantel cross and we focus on legislation changes specifically Al the new duty to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace I will be adding a disclaimer to this episode it doesn't constitute legal advice in any capacity it is purely an education resource for our listeners and also one more thing make sure that you like share and subscribe to this podcast it means so much to us and it allows us to keep going with these episodes week on week Chantel welcome to the Pod uh thank you thank you for asking me honestly this is such an exciting topic that we're going to talk about today and I I've got to give creds for this episode to Paris as part of the plum team because you were at a plum event and this is exactly why we're here today which is so exciting yes yes I've thoroughly enjoyed it best steak I think I've ever had so but anyway I digress for our listeners I would really love for you to set the scene a little bit and there's a question that I love to ask every single guest which is was HR part of the plan or did you fall into it so I was about 25 26 something like that no 24 anyway that doesn't matter um I was about 24 and uh there were people coming onto the market younger than me better qualified than me and I just thought I need something that's going to be a career really and and I started to look at accountancy qualifications and then realized that mean numbers just are not friends and um and then my boss actually suggested HR and I taught them into sponsoring me for an initial sort of quite basic qualification and then just went from there how long have you been in the HR space well given that I'm only you know 26 you know years two years no no about 20 years plus V8 amazing and from where you were when you first started out at 24 compared to where you are now tell me a bit more about the position that you're in at the moment so well of difference really I mean since 24 I've had quite a lot of experience in um private sector public sector third sector um and mainly education for some reason it it's odd because both of my parents are are also teachers so it's weird but um yes I got a lot of job satisfaction generally from helping had teachers was quite difficult and complex um er problems mainly um and then I with my last contract I just decided uh that ended I I was not sure that I wanted to stay in in HR so I went off and followed some shiny things for about a year and then um it was odd we we decided to set up a limited company myself my husband and then this course came along that talked about moving from um corporate to consultancy by Sarah Hamilton Gil she's on LinkedIn um so I did that course was really good and then I did the subsequent sales course and then um this legislation came in so it's all quite serendipitous um and I've always been very passionate about the whole reason I got into HR was to make sure people were treated well at work you spend so much time at work you just really need to um enjoy it really um so I kind of got got into it for those reasons as well plus it's really quite interesting um and it's challenging and there's kind of a good career path I think what the really important thing is as well is there has been significant legislative changes especially with the new prevention Duty that's come into place would you mind telling our listeners why that came into place so there is an awful lot of evidence um literally everywhere you look that it's a bit of a problem I mean you've only got to look at the news haven't you but even before then there I mean there there's some technical guidance that the equality and Human Rights Commission have put together um and uh they actually did a report called Turning Tables a few years ago um that really looked into the issues you know was it an issue I post and they had actually found that 75% of respondents had experienced sexual harassment at work and that's not an isolated report um the there there is plenty of evidence um there's also there was also a tu report in 2019 and they looked as well at how how it affects the lgbtq community and 68% of them had also um been harassed um at work due to their sex or their gender reassignment or you know so it it's a a big issue it is a big issue if we were to strip this back for some of our listeners who may not have the knowledge your understanding of sexual harassment how would you define that well it it's defined in law um so harassment itself is actually connected to uh one of the nine protected characteristics um so age disability Etc but sexual harassment is specifically to do with um of a sexual nature uh but there is a specific legal definition it talks about unwanted conduct and um of an unacceptable nature and also that's one of the main things with what we want as well from today's episode is that people understand the definition of sexual harassment that it is unwanted conduct of a sexual nature and we do really hope that our listeners get some amazing tips which I know from our conversations that we've had previously that they absolutely will the changes came in as of 26th of October 2024 we've now moved more towards a progressive way with the new preventative Duty and as part of the duty there is the requirement for employers to look at what's reasonable for them as well there was talks previously around all reasonable adjustments and then reasonable adjustments but now we've got further Clarity don't we within the legislation and what that looks like are employers required to be responsible for all reasonable adjustments or is it reasonable it's reasonable yeah so they did a bit of the okey Ki with that in out in out shake it all about but um yes eventually um I think it was just a drafting drafting error and they did clarify that in the end so what are the most significant changes in the new preventative Duty and how can they impact businesses so the well the main issue the the main change is that it's a proactive Duty and it compels employers to not just react when there's an issue but actually look at their business organization as a whole and look at how they can prevent it from happening in the first place obviously what is appropriate for each business is going to depend on uh you know who their customers are what business they do historical issues where the power imbalances are personalities the policies in in place and the culture that's developed I absolutely love that you've just said there that basically it's not a one-size fit all we can't be going in now after this new legislation with a blanket approach it doesn't work it's got to be customized for your business for your demographic because also the new Duty extends to third parties it doesn't just at this precise moment but I do believe it is coming in it's planned within the legislation but right now there there is no opportunity for a freestanding uh third party claim however um I always advise clients that you need to take that into account in any case cuz it's coming I think it's coming it's also the right thing to do it's like why wouldn't you want to protect your staff from being harassed as part of their job you just started talking then about how employers can customize their sexual harassment prevention strategies within the organization could you give me a few examples of what that could look like I think a good place to start really is a quite detailed risk assessment that is tailored to sexual harassment in the workplace so you're looking at your your the policies you've got in place who your your um employees interact with the other thing to mention is that it's not just employees it's wider than that there's a wider scope it's workers as well and in some cases it's self-employed individual ual so um this duty is really quite wide but as I was saying the risk assessment is a good place to start um because you can also look at um reporting systems whether people are loone working um pockets of power imbalances and then based on that you can also take that into okay so what does that look like for the business what do we need to do as a result of this we know there's a risk here because Mildred is working late on a Friday night and has all these truckers I don't know come coming in that's the reality as well and one thing to really take away from this is it isn't possible to do a one-sized fits all I know we've already spoke about that but there are so many measures that employers and people leaders can be putting in place as part of that prevention you spoke then around risk assessment is there anything else that you would recommend as a tip well the other really big thing um apart from sort of obviously customizing your training uh is really to look at your staff your staff will know what's going on so if you're not already doing a staff survey um then you need to be looking at that I mean I've had really some really odd comments um so one client I heard had said um but we haven't had any reports of sexual harassment so why do we need to bother with this there's significant evidence that people do not report this because they don't think they're going to be listened to they are concerned about the impact it will have on their career as well as it's not very nice to actually have to talk about it in the first place um there's so many reasons why people don't report you've got to make it easy for them and you've got to remove the barriers I am so glad that you've mentioned this because the percentage of people who don't come forward for a lot of reasons is significantly high and there is no invisibility cloak that will stop you from experiencing sexual harassment in the workplace regardless of your size your industry nobody is immuned to it and that's something that I also get a very similar response to the one that you had where potentially now because working Dynamics have changed we're not always in the office and people associate unwanted conduct with physical engagement and physical interaction the way that the world has evolved we have social media now which has created a whole different ball game of communication and unwanted contact doesn't have to be just physical physically touching somebody there are other forms as well that are simply unwanted yeah absolutely I mean you could even and what I was saying earlier on is this this duty is so wide because people you could actually just witness behavior that creates an intimidating environment for you there is some case law whereby um individuals were known to be downloading porn in an office and the there was a lady working in the same office as them she knew they were downloading porn they never showed her it she never complained about it but that was a legal challenge afterwards because it created a hostile and intimidating environment if you overhear something that you find offensive if someone gives you a a compliment uh that could be taken the wrong way if you start off with banter and you you know everybody's having a laugh and everybody's laughing and it's it's all fine until it's not now I'm not saying we need to like just cut the banter because oh my God we need we do need to have a laugh at work don't we gosh yeah we do I think the advice really is to just stay away from uh protected characteristics you know like age sex I I I completely agree and as part of that with the new prent Duty employeers and people leaders need to be taking ownership of the comms around what's acceptable as well within the workplace with the shift on technology we are using more social interactions for quick communication like teams slack all of those channels and within those people can send emojis people can send memes which may not be acceptable in somebody else's opinion because it's no it's no longer just about how your in attentions were when you sent that as well and I think that's also really important and we've got to raise awareness to our teams and our people leaders of the reality of that yeah they don't they don't really care what your intention was um I think there was a case I I just came across uh where uh there was some legal challenge where a boss was sending peaches Peach emojis um can't remember the name now but I'm sure it will come to me as some point and that's a perfect example as well yeah absolutely because if anyone's in the Emoji world we we know what a peach stands for in your opinion what would you say are the essential components that an employer should be thinking about when they're trying their preventative Duty the reason I asked that question is I have done a little bit of research on you and I know that you've got your toolkit if you'd like to share a bit more on that so the essential components it's going to be that's a really difficult one to answer actually because so much is going to depend on the type of business the size how much work they've already done if there's any specific RI risks or hotpots or um but what you want to be doing is actually really you know there's the obvious things like the training and the policies and and how you engage that but this this Duty as as we've talked about is slightly wider so I would say just get started with a risk assessment that would be a good starting point um and uh the there is case law also to suggest that this isn't a a one shot and then you're done in terms of training either it needs to be regular so for example a couple of my clients are multi-academy Trust and um I think they have they're sort of a step further on than other businesses because they're used to delivering safeguarding training annually for example so I think I think that that they could introduce it that way but it does need to be regularly updated a key part you've mentioned there that your client has already start to build the Habit with their training for a lot of organizations they don't have the infrastructure for that and a key piece with this legislation that we should have been doing before when we had wind that the legislation was changing and absolutely something that we should be doing now and I'm sure you'll agree on this is starting to build better habits in how do we raise awareness and education to our team of how to report unwanted conduct of a sexual nature if they experience it themselves but also if they identify that as a witness and you mentioned as well that we should make it easy for reporting and unfortunately allegations haven't necessarily come to light in the past and potentially not knowing how to raise those could be quite a influencing Factor on that absolutely and there's several approaches I mean you've hit the nail on the head ultimately we we need to it's cultural piece we've mentioned that before so we and we also need to look at um how you know on a scale of 1 to 10 in your culture how comfortable are people reporting things and how and and how confident are you in in taking action are you also making notes about where there are near misses so a really good indicator of a a brilliant culture that we're all we're all St um striving for is whereby a female colleague reported that a male colleague was just wasn't really giving her enough space she didn't feel it was harassment but it kept sort of happening and and she felt uncomfortable so the um manager sort of said well how would you want it dealt with you know and can we get you can I have a word with him and she said yes of course of course so he had a word with him and um absolutely reacted very positively and was you know oh I'm I'm glad you told me and you know um can we can we have a chat and they got together and they talked about it and then they moved on and that's an example of where we all want to get to um and if you're not there then how can we get you there um so the tool kit that I offer actually saves you um probably around 90 hours of work and it's everything I could think of it's written in conjunction with a leading employment law barister and uh we it includes two policies um I've also significantly expanded the training um so I I put in uh a 23 page step-by-step guidance for managers um I tailor the training I do posters um I've written coms um that you can send out to staff in inviting them to the training I've got coms for third parties that you can send out as well um and also a quiz as well that follows up the training that tests the knowledge so then you can then look at any gaps that that remain if you look at the Quality and Human Rights Commission they have like a wheel a process of what what you should go through in terms of looking at your culture so that actually ticks off one of the one of the areas amongst others in terms of checking the knowledge again it's not a one hit and you're done how are you reinforcing it how are you engaging your staff so I I do literally think of everything because I'm pretty much living and breathing this right now I'm so passionate about it I think it's so important that everybody feels safe to come to work and it's a no-brainer in terms of productivity and the impact on that tell me more about that so when it comes to addressing workplace sexual harassment and putting the preventative measures in place what are the what are the potential impacts that we can see on productivity and the company culture as a whole so the rewards for this are potentially very very significant there was a report done by McKenzie um that said uring gender equality in in the UK has the potential to add 150 billion pounds to business as usual in terms of the GDP forecasts in in 20125 um it makes good business sense because it's all about reducing turnover you're going to have increased absenteeism if people are being effectively bullied or harassed at work or don't feel comfortable doing what they want to do even if they're turning up to work do you think they're really going to be productive um if people do leave then that you know that place is more pressure on other staff you got increased recruitment costs um bystanders perhaps feel um helpless and disillusioned and anxious and then they're going to start start talking it's increased risk as well Financial Risk this comes under discrimination so the financial penalties are uncapped and if you can't prove if you can't stand up in front of a a judge and say this is what we've done uh this is what we did to prevent it confidently and prove that you took reasonable steps then they can uplift that award by 25% now the other interesting thing that I found is that tribunals will take into account the resources available to you as a small organization they will they will however when it gets to the sanction side of things they won't they have very you know they have the vento bans and other mechanisms to deciding how much that organization has to pay and they will not take into account whether you can afford it so you could bankrupt your business in in one easy swoop and I don't I don't mean to scare people because honestly it's not rocket scientist I do it it's not rocket science I mean if I can do it it's definitely not and um for a tiny tiny amount we can do this cultural piece that was will actually make your organization more profitable so why wouldn't you do it I am banging that drum with you at the same time and a really important message and takeway is an allegation or an individual's um unfortunate circumstance of unwanted conduct isn't just in Silo it isn't just that one scenario that and that's happening the impact is very significant regardless of the size of your business nobody is immuned and where the new Duty comes in is that extra responsibility that employers have and it's not a choice to ignore this and have the response of well it's never happened to me it's you know we're all friends here it will never happen we've never had things like that before with businesses it is people basically and that's where we need to be more proactive EX exctly what you've just been saying and I absolutely love that to build a healthier culture and a psychologically safe culture as well absolutely the other thing to mention is just how wide this this duty is um I was in on a networking meeting once and um I this chap asked me what I did so I started to to tell him and he said oh that won't apply to us cuz we're all Bloks at my way what do you and it's like I don't know where to start that's a really big misconception though it is very much so so let me give you an example so one of the cases that I go through on the training is so I'll give you a sneak preview is um and this bearing in mind this is before all the legislation came in so there's a chap called Mi Mr English and he worked for Thomas Sanderson blinds he'd been there a number of years the interesting um point on this is that he was an agency worker so he wasn't an employee but he'd been there quite a long time he lived in Brighton and he'd been to public school and his manager started um teasing him about being gay now Mr English was not gay there's nothing wrong with being gay but he he did not have that protected characteristic as it were um in terms of sexual orientation he was happily married and he had had two kids um and he also knew that his tormentors knew that he wasn't gay so they and it went all the way up to the court of appeal um and he was found to have been harassed at work and that was back in 2008 you asked me earlier actually you were talking you were asking what can small businesses do um to tackle this you know where are the sort of where do you start and it really is with managers because actually the vast majority of the harassment starts with the managers you know they're in the business they can see the behaviors that are happening um and they need the tools to be able to deal with them such an important point there as well and with that case it's a perfect example that although you give a really amazing statistic around 50% it doesn't necessarily have to just be a male with a female who most of the time is more Junior in their role it can be the reverse and there are quite a lot of case law examples as well of when that has happened unfortunately there are also quite a lot of cases that are in the media at the moment as well which is sparking the conversation around sexual harassment and for our listeners this has essentially come in because of the new GT that's coming as of the 26th of October 2024 what advice would you give to any business owners who may have already started to implement the preventative Duty and any anti-harassment measures but on very surface very surface level they've done what they think they need to do what advice would you give them to go that extra mile to be honest give us a call love a chat yeah um I'm always happy to have an informal chat um with business owners um but I really it's really difficult to answer that question if I'm honest with you because like I said before it's it's tailored to the business um but you can hop on the and look at the equality and Human Rights Commission technical guidance that's really good but it's massive um and it will take you quite a lot of time I mean so I I just honestly think that it's most cost effective just to get an expert in like myself if I'm honest with you because it will save you time and anxiety and you'll know that I've done all the hard thinking for you for our people leaders as well who are listening a core part of this is the prevention side we've said that one so many times on this episode as well and firstly looking at what you doing already what's what's working what isn't what are the gaps that we're identifying things like when was the last time we updated any of our policies disciplinary grievance social media are we up to date with the advances of the world consider things like that and taking this seriously yes at the same time absolutely yeah I mean you need to take this very seriously and whilst there is a focus on the prevention side of things how you react as well if a complaint does come to light will also Al be taken into account so going back to your point about it's not always you know uh men men harassing women there are it is overwhelmingly men harassing women however there are is Cas law about the reverse um and it could literally be one or two incidents so there was a case called goof go V Asda uh whereby a male employee complained that a female employee I think had kicked him twice or something and it was shockingly badly dealt with he was not kept up today he made a complaint and then they didn't do anything about it and then I think he had to raise a formal grievance and then they didn't keep him updated and um I think he felt that it just wasn't being taken seriously very wise lesson to to employers about this sity of this yeah absolutely and I think um that cost them about 30k wow and if you think about going to a tribunal yes you probably settle beforehand or whatever but you're probably going to need some legal advice if you choose to fight it you're probably looking at 50,000 roughly for a 3-day 3-day tribun all hearing as a minimum as well I think with it being uncapped no that's just to fight it oh just to that's just to fight it so getting the legal advice the loss in management time the stress the you know the impact on productivity and then you know there there's the there's the a lot to consider is a very big message from our conversation as well yeah I honestly I don't want to scare m I I really but it is what it is and there's a very simple solution um have a look at that technical guidance um do your risk assessment do your um your staff survey you'll get an awful lot from that um and if I can help great thank you so much one final question that I've got for you looking back on your career what is one piece of advice that you wish you could give your younger self if I'm honest with you I probably would have not done H I'm glad I did now because I'm I'm doing what I feel passionate about and I really feel like I'm making a difference but actually I really wish I'd done something a bit more Arty you are very creative so yeah I got into um resinart in um lockdown and before I knew it I mean I think I've got suspected ADHD but before I knew it you know I had um a YouTube channel with 160 odd videos so the thing is as well with HR we don't have to remain in a box like I'm incredibly creative as well with the way that I practice HR and that's the beauty of it I do think that we can pull on our creative outlet definit and bake that into what we do as HR professionals I am loving creating my marketing materials um Cana I just love I've had to I've had to buy the professional version it's my best friend too I can lose days on that until Chantel thank you so much for joining me on today's episode I know talking about sexual harassment is a particularly sensitive one today is all about being brave with our conversations that we're having and we have had such a good conversation I know our listeners are going to have such valuable takeaways so thank you so much for joining me and let us know what you think of the episode guys do you have any questions and thank you very much thank you"

everything you need to meet compliance requirements and it's also going to help you recognize prevent and respond to work placements conduct plus there is a quiz at the end to test your knowledge so let's get started this training meets Federal harassment prevention standards but please check with your state laws for any additional requirements hi I'm harlo Reed employment lawyer HR consultant and creator of the HR Insider did you know that more than 60% of people who face harassment at work never even bother to report it and even when they do they often don't see any real change or justice so for people who are watching something like that happen on the sidelines it creates an additional barrier to harassment prevention today we are going to talk about how to spot the signs of harassment how to report it and how to take steps to stop it when it does occur because we all deserve a safe and respectful place to work let's talk about it a key step in stopping workplace misconduct is truly understanding what it is so we can quickly spot it when it happens let's begin by defining the different types of workplace misconduct so let's start with bullying essentially Bullying happens when someone is repeatedly mistreated at work this could be harsh language that's used disrespectful actions or even deliberate efforts to sabotage someone's work I covered this topic in a case called Susan Baldwin V Blue Cross despite having five pages of documented bullying incidents her case didn't meet the legal standard for harassment to learn why check out my full video on this case Linked In the description okay so next up is harassment harassment is any unwelcome Behavior based on race color religion sex national origin age disability or genetic information I covered harassment in Greater detail in my video it called fired for being a woman that video is about Twitter layoffs and it takes a deeper look into how systemic harassment is connected to gender discrimination so check it out if you want to get more understanding about harassment in the workplace next up is sexual harassment which is unwelcome sexual advances requests for sexual favors or any verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature workplace violence is another form of harassment that's defined as any Act of physical violence threats intimidation or disruptive behavior in the workplace discrimination is another form of harassment and it is defined as unfair or unequal treatment based on legally protected characteristics legally protected characteristics include race color national origin sex including pregnancy sexual orientation and gender identity religion disability physical or mental age 40 years or older that's protected under the age discrimination in Employment Act genetic information including family medical history which would be protected under Gina citizenship or immigration status which is protected under the immigration and National and additional protections could apply under state laws another form of harassment is retaliation retaliation is any adverse action taken against an employee for engaging in Legally protected activities such as filing a complaint or participating in an investigation an adverse action is any negative action when it's taken by an employer that harms an employee or job applicant in response to their decision to exercise a legally protected activity examples include the termination or firing of an employee the demotion or reduction in an employees job responsibilities reduction in pay or benefits negative performance evaluations that are unfair or retaliatory transfer to a less desirable position or job shift increased scrutiny or disciplinary action without valid cause exclusion from training promotions or career advancement opportunities threats intimidation or harassment in response to a complaint and cutting hours or denying work opportunities if you want to know more about adverse actions in the workplace check out my video that covers the legal case of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center versus nissar unchecked misconduct can damage employee morale increase turnover lower productivity and expose employers to Legal liability and most importantly it creates an unsafe and unhealthy work environment to learn more about how unhealthy environments affect employers and employees check out my video workplace mobbing and retaliation in medicine it's every organization's responsibility to create a work environment that prioritizes respect safety and fairness both employers and their supervisors have specific responsibilities employers must take proactive steps to prevent harassment and discrimination and this includes providing regular harassment prevention training establishing clear policies and reporting procedures and always responding promptly to complaints supervisors have additional responsibilities including recognizing potential misconduct early and taking appropriate action to address those issues employees who experience or if they witness workplace misconduct should document everything writing down dates times Witnesses and detailed descriptions of what they've seen or experienced employees are expected to report misconduct by following the company's reporting procedures whether that's through human resources or an Anonymous hotline employees should know their rights by familiarizing themselves with both federal and state protections and if you have witnessed or experi experienced any of these behaviors at work how would you handle it share your thoughts about it in the comment section every organization should have a clear reporting process typically this would include reporting the incident to Human Resources a direct supervisor or through a designated complaint process but employees also have the right to report harassment to external agencies like the equal employment opportunity commission if internal procedures don't resolve the issue satisfactorily there are serious consequences for violating harassment policies including disciplinary actions whether that's warning suspension or even termination and there can be legal repercussions as well including fines and lawsuits employers can also face legal action for failing to address harassment complaints appropriately to make sure you understand the content we've covered today I've prepared a short quiz that's going to help you reflect on some of the concepts that we reviewed the link is in the description uh below so please take a look at it here's a quick scenario for you to think about if you overhear a coworker making inappropriate comments to another employee what should you do pause the video for a minute and think about

rescue bye all right so um let's now are we live we are live okay so um good morning this is Friday February 14th I'm um representative Molly Burke of Boro chair of the house sexual harassment prevention panel and we're here with members of the panel and uh our attorneys and um representative from Human Resources and we are here to discuss a proposal to um address confidentiality issues between the three panels the ethics panel the sexual harassment prevention panel and the um discrimination prevention panel and so I'm going to so and our agenda will be that we will talk about that we're going to discuss a bill that's being presented by representative buroughs to address some um uh jurisdictions and and uh begin a discussion about a SharePoint site for document sharing that I think you had suggested last year representative Hedrick had done and any other business that members want to bring so um our attorney Maggie pin will start with the proposal great so I handed out this document um house resolution updating house rules and this was drafted um in order to allow the ethics panel greater leeway in sharing information and it really does four things so and the ethics panel is a little bit different in sort of its transparency concerns um and uh its rules are also slightly different to begin with so what these rules would change is upon closing a case it would allow the panel to a brief statement of the issue in the resolution to the public um this would increase public confidence in the institution by showing the attention to ethical issues and the statement would go on the ethics panel's website um and it would also allow the ethics panel to make certain statements about cases that are in the public domain they have found that occasionally word will get out in into the media of an issue and the ethics panel can't say anything um and these sorts of issues have come up with both this panel and the Discrimination prevention panel um and it would allow them to uh clear up misunderstandings or correct um wrong information that's gotten out into the public and let the public know that they are addressing the issue without um you know giving more information that really than really is necessary um this potential change to the house rules would also allow the ethics panel to communicate with members and staff of this panel and of the Discrimination prevention panel um to inform an investigation that either this panel or the Discrimination panel is doing um if and when there's sort of crossover between issues and the thought is that that could be very help to know what's going on um again keeping the confidentiality Circle small so that if the ethics if imagine something came up in this panel and um you know representative Burke or I or arleene or somebody were to say to a member of the ethics panel or their staff do we have a thing do you Al do you have any information about this because that could be very important in the way that this panel handles the issue um knowing either that it is being addressed somewhere else or that it is an issue that has come up before and perhaps deserves greater attention um so that would allow for some limited information sharing in that instance and then finally their changes as reflected in this document would allow the fic panel to communicate with law enforcement um um if and when that became necessary this panel can already do that but their rules are um more sort of concrete oh so so what representative Burke and I were asked um in a meeting that we went to with representative Lan and Betsy an speaker and a couple of other people was what is what does this panel think about that change because this change does um involve this panel it references this panel um and they thought it would be important just to make sure that this was something that would be agreeable to this panel meaning it it they just want to know that there there's no objection here to the ethics panel being able to answer questions um or anything like that I did have this discussion with the Discrimination sevention panel yesterday and they said yeah sure that's fine um they may elect to make a similar change in the future to allow them to talk to this panel and the ethics panel but they want to do a little work beforehand um to sort of think about what their work is and how they want to communicate but but they were agreeable to the change and I let um the ethics panel and the speaker know so that's the first question um is whether this panel is agreeable to the ethics panel making these changes um and whether there are any concerns and the change is Simply Having access to the fact that they are working on something that we may or are working on and how much detail do we get I think it would depend I mean I think it's sort of a caseby case basis because they're not going to want to disclose more than would be helpful um but I I just think it's not it's not well um I don't think it's well fleshed out Beyond allowing for that possibility and keeping the general principle in mind that it's kind of a need to know the situation shut up are you sure I have other questions but I want to Mo this over I have a new Direction that's a little more specified good I'm looking at section g this is the section that allows the panel to talk to the public that is just pertaining to them right this not are right this does not give us any new permissions right right okay but if they know that we're working on something or or any details of what we're working on doesn't that right reach our efforts to be confidential yeah great question so this only goes one way it says um records received under these rules and procedures of the panel as follows to the members or staff of the discrimin prevention panel or the members of or staff of the sexual harassment prevention panel to inform an investigation under these rules by either panel right so we would be giving some information right but they they still I think wouldn't be they would still be breaching their confidentiality Provisions by giving out anything pertaining to us you know yeah I think Caroline's question is critical here um even a statement to the press such as we're in collaboration with the other with the other panels we're indicating that they could be talking to other yes but would they have to state in collaboration with panels y oh wow that's such a great question um ask yeah I I want to I I think there are some important differences between the work that the ethics panel is asked to do but our panel is asked to do discrimination especially ours um in the the protections that this panel has around confidentiality um cross into areas that the other two don't I think yeah right and um into areas that if we give even a hint of what we're doing that um that speculation starts to Blossom in ways that could be really decal to especially the impacted individuals right this is our future work yeah yeah no really yeah I mean so we could say something like you know any Disclosure by the the ethics panel can't reference any information that has come to them from this panel or shared or even that we're collaborating or even that there is any collaboration but on the other hand they can make this change and we can never ask them anything right right they can't reach in and get information from us this just allows us to ask them something and if we never do they never get but that's a different provision within it that's a separate thing than the disclosure to the public yeah see so maybe it could be some there can be no disclosure relating to the work of any other P okay yeah you know something along that line might or coll the work ofor just say we're investigating this case it's going to be very limited what they're going to say anyway and there would be any there would be no they wouldn't have if we say no then they can't even ever mention us right not the way this is written mean or discrimination or the fact of communication with okay can you tell me again what the benefit to them is to do this um that's a also a really good question they problem they're solving here yeah um getting ahead of misinformation getting ahead yeah I think sometimes you run into situations where there's lot like you can't stop people that are involved in a situation from talking about it right and so then in the perception is well something's happened but there's no indication that anyone's addressing it or doing anything so I'm my assumption from what you were saying earlier Magie was that this is something that the ethics panel can can say we're of the situation and we're looking at it right that it's it's just to the the sense that no one's taking any action it's just I think to address that perception it's not to share information about what they're doing it's just to reassure the public that we are looking at wew than doing St but that's a pretty common situation whether it's a school board dealing with a teacher in executive session they can't say anything and sometimes never and or other boards I mean it's not an uncommon situation and it it's a the veil has to be can't be pulled back or it's it's a bigger problem more more crack in the door so this so g g section g what not the part about sharing among committees yes no there like two things going on yeah right I don't have a problem there I may want to ask a question um right in the course of an investigation out of this panel well that question to the ethics panel might be important but I don't want the ethics panel then to be able to say yeah we've been working with the sexual harass could there be a statement from say leadership or something saying we have an Ethics panel that's addressing uh we have an Ethics panel that's that's set up to investigate ethics violations without saying we are investigating in the present but just to sort of reiterate you know if people start hearing things I don't know yeah I don't see anything wrong with that and I don't see that we have any power to make that happen that's up to the and what we do is up to us because in public that there is an Ethics panel you know and there's a it's you know and like for instance even this meeting is being you know people know that we have a sexual harassment and we meet we're meeting we have agendas that are posted so you know if if and long as long as it's you know can can be posted as long as it's not confidential I think there's too much room for a slip up but we aren't many of the some lawyers so we come here we get the training from the staff councel uh then we hope everybody understands it and obeys it but uh I think there's too much room here for a slip up and then someone getting hurt by it yeah falsely accused or gossip or something it's just not I don't think but I I'd like to do something I like working collaboratively so I would like a you know something to reach back no we don't want to do this but we will we maybe just getting rid of the public disclosure that they're collaborating that know we can collaborate so just section g is the yeah the concern from this panel is allaround section g but not the rest of it I'm under standing yes per you have any knowledge of any other group doing anything like this in your work environment or in your experience a wedge of I mean nothing coming out of I'm just trying to think of recent cases right you can all consider ubm cases recently where um there have been pretty significant um formal complaints from members of the university community who don't feel the university is taking tal line investigation seriously um I'm just trying to think of the and you were there I mean I'm trying to think of the comments that would have come out of that um and I think there were all pretty AO play we have a process trust the process sort of but it doesn't it doesn't really know it just there is a process is kind of didn't correct me if you recall but we could look at Rec newspapers I I I would be very surprised if there was any yeah detail or names or and that and Communications all comes out Communications doesn't come from the to line office it doesn't come from our office um comes from University yeah so I I'm I get I mean there's not a Prohibition for me to talk to the Press but when it comes to individual cases my standard respones and not talking person Communications about that and I think line too is the saying I would have to look at recent articles from that were covering those compliant but I think they all were centralized out of even Communications which kind of goes back to what someone said about maybe the statement doesn't come from the ethics panel comes from the speaker that there is a process all right and we have an ethic you know that it doesn't and that way the members or the ethics panel isn't put on the spot either to worry about saying too much or too yeah or somebody asking a member of the ethics panel oh you know you're doing an investigation can you tell me more about it yeah slip offs happen yeah oh yeah sure know she forgot see that couldn't happen so easily so easily in my experience is media is different now in a way that you can get somebody in your face in a minute what about this I I we need to be careful so I think what they're saying here is that they would issue if it becomes known they would issue a statement as it may deem appropriate to confirm the existence of the investigation to clarify the procedural aspects of the investigation and to explain that the respondent is entitled to Due Process like what if I don't think it's the ability to just comment yeah so what if there were some like right to review any statement that the that involved a case that this panel had been involved in you know what I mean before anything goes out just to make sure that it satisfies the confidentiality concerns here I mean as I read the end of G it is very limiting about what they can say confirm the existent just to conf clarify the procedural aspects and to explain that's the part clarify procedural aspects the procedure now includes consultation with our committee I wouldn't want that to so just that one part is really yes to clarify the procedural aspects of Investigation so it also sort of indicates that there's a WI investigation unless it's limiting what the ethics pan procedures process procedures may be change as a change proced parameters so they would just be able to uh confirm the existence of the investigation and explain that the respond is entitled to do process that's better so yeah that that's less concerning yes I yeah I don't want to get into the business of telling the ethics panel how they want to communicate with anybody I just want to protect any collaboration this as being private with any other that the all the like the policies and the procedures that go in this panel and the Discrimination panel I would assume for the ethics panel I mean that's publicly available right so again I mean you don't need to explain what the procedures are you can just say here's the link to the procedures I mean that might get added to a procedure you know like if we were to pass it wouldn't the fact that it's in the procedure wouldn't indicate that this particular situation has being referred to a panel it would just be you know these are our procedures these are the steps that that we go through right you I assume the procedes for these are available they are I think the idea was to be able to provide some clarity in particular cases and say you know this is what we did from the procedures but so I think it's a little more detailed than then so I think the concern still exists in terms of taking potentially the concern about clarify the procedural aspects so you're saying that clarify the procedure aspects would mean providing more explanation it's not just these are the procedures but providing when we say in rule whatever what we mean is uh and this is how it was applied in this particular instance that you guys already know about press and I think that the concern is present there of some kind of disclosure and you know as for the house rules we did talk to another panel right and that's the problem yeah yeah yeah so so are we are we saying that the S of G minus the procedur aspects being that language taken out uh I don't I don't know if I'm going to come up with an answer of language right now I'm to turn it over to the attorneys and see what they want to do I can talk to Mike and Betsy an yeah see what they have to say and what their potential solution is because it's a really good concern I had thought about that maybe um Martin too oh for sure so Michael Grady okay so we want to say that we're not we need more information y time okay right thank you for bringing that yeah well Martin um initiated this yeah I do like where we can set up some parameters for clearing the air or nudging towards correct information the Press statement I like the each it could really benefit best okay all right thank you yeah great great conversation question um all right item number two on the agenda all right so uh represent the Burrows is putting in um if you remember um we introduced the sexual harassment panel and the Discrimination panel introduced a bill last year members to um extend the um jurisdiction in cases of of complaints about Central arrestment to Statewide office holders am I correct that that was what we did in the bill right and we talked about it last time and since then uh representative burough said she's modified so she was going to just resubmit that bill and now I talked to her and she said she's modifying the bill I wrote to her just thought about it last night because I realized I didn't have a copy and she is at home um attending a meeting and won't be back here until later so I don't really have any information about what changes she's made so what I can do is um once we get the that language I can circulate it and just see whether people want to sign on or not that yeah okay yeah I I think we've discussed um representative K you were not here when we did but we did discuss and we all signed on last year and I think I'd said it the last we because I hadn't read it yeah like I'm not signing on anything probably fantastic but until I've actually read it I'm not signing on and now it's been modified so so I'll send the language around when I get it and to everybody and then comment through group email does that sound do we have email just to well to Meers and and to everyone present in this room okay um and so um so then I guess uh I could take charge of getting signatures for representative Bros with our group if everybody agrees okay all right I'm going agree thank you okay um because that's coming up next week you have to some good things um okay that's that now um Maggie do you want to talk about the SharePoint yes yeah okay so I believe last year representative Hedrick you raised the concern of not having a secure place to store documents so that everything is in the right place and look review documents so they're not flying around by email um so Arlene worked with it to put together a SharePoint site and I've looked at it and created three four folders um one of inquiries so when this panel gets an inquiry um rule one it gets shared between all of the panel members and this would allow us to track all of the inquiries that that we get um and then I created a folder for current cases so any open matter that goes to either an informal resolution or becomes a formal complaint um we can keep all of the emails the letters the communications anything that comes in so that we have it in one place securely um to make sure that nothing is lost and everything is considered um I also created a folder for closed cases so once something is done it will go in that folder um so that it can be looked at for later and then I also created a folder for documents to reference so I put that list of confidential resources in that folder um and then we also have the policy and the procedural document there as well um at a later meeting we can do a training for everybody to look at the site see how it works it is very intuitive yeah um it does require multiactor authentication okay I don't know if I sorry that was going to be my question yes so you do need the the MFA to get into the site that's good um yes it is good um and deia can help anybody who doesn't have that function on their account to get that set up it's it's pretty easy it's a good thing anyway um just to keep things secure um so is something that you gets onto your computer is that it yes so it's a it's a website I think it's it's linked to your Microsoft account yeah it's link to outl look and then the multiactor is often times I think there are probably other options um when you're logging in it'll say um you know it'll send a pen to your text it'll text to a pen like often when you're doing other things you get P I have that like for my ledge email if I'm using my desktop at home or whatever I have I get a text to my phone so anybody with access to this SharePoint set of folders um would would have to use that multiactive yes and only those of us here would that even be an option correct nobody else can get in it does allow for the Locking of a Word document so once a Word document is created it can't be printed it can't be screenshotted you have to just review it in that on your computer um which is nice that's good um do the iPads can you you can get it from the iPads too right iPads yeah I think so um so everybody is I think currently does have the permission to be in there I work with deia on making sure that um the correct permissions were set up and she is I mean you know where she is she's in the lounge she can help anybody who needs it get into that and you can also attend one of these meetings just to show everybody how it works and answer any questions yeah we did it yesterday with the Discrimination prevention panel and it was very how long does it take um 15 minutes 20 minutes it's not bad at all so what we should do maybe is just schedule another meeting for yeah everybody I think that that makes sense and I don't know what people's time is we have two more weeks unbelievably before our break so think maybe after the break I say we don't have anythingit Town meetings and everything maybe we could think about in March the middle of whatever the end of the first week that we come back does that make sense that Friday whatever date that is probably um [Music] oh it's the same be the 14th 28 all right so March 14th one month for March 14th okay so um and you take care of setting up any themom for that and yes indeed whatever I mean obviously some of the way that's just and I'll schedule with jilia and yeah in the meantime if and when there are documents that come in I'll just make sure they get in the right folders so that things are yes and I just want to clarify so the next step in this process for the agenda item number one is that you're going to talk and to Martin yes and then I should we wait to until the our meeting again to talk about that how should we how should we resolve this issue um I can see what their proposal is and what their timeline is I I just don't know okay so you'll communicate with us yes and if we do need a like I they're just a one-on-one discussion with you to sign off or whatever then we could do that yes okay great right any other business how's every body doing I appreciate all assistance of our attorneys and Human Resources experts so thank you very much you are welcome and thank you sorry to get basketball game

can get on to the next oh sorry I have agendas and I'm sorry that somehow they didn't get form very well but [Music] okaya so why don't you start Caroline my name is Caroline I'm the state representative and I represent the towns of Georgia and fair of Franklin County this is my 21st year in serving year in STS and also you've been the committee for well I I did take two terms off you know ways that so that's why people that came in with me like with Pat Bron those folks have any 21 years for me and you served on this Comm to this yes but that was my first term on this committee but get on way the means we um I'm Beth quy pal 3 I represent Sheffield V Sutton New workk in Lyon I was appointed last spring and it's my first poll that I mutant today and welcome and we're really happy you're following in the footsteps of your wonderful motherby uh it's right I'm a representative from Burlington Burlington and around the campus in hospital and to the Wi Bridge um I'm walking into my second term and also my second term to or I'm arene Ben I'm the director of legislative um Human Resources so nice to be here with you again I'm Sophie to so I'm relatively new to the office of legislative Council since October and I've um taken over the portfolio that Dan land had had with so I'm there in the same role that Dan would have been previously he's moved over to transportome I'm Dy bar I'm the HR attorney in um office of human resources and I'm doing the procedural and Cas processing piece that Damian did and we really appreciate your help as you came in last year to step into thank you I've only been here since March so welcome thank you good morning I'm Mike wew you and um it's taking a while but all of a sudden overnight i g the appalation of old fart and uh entering my 10th ter here and I come I'm a southerner like Molly we're down in southeast Kingdom uh I represent put and D from the LI for district and uh I've been on this for a few years yeah appreciate that let's do the work we've been we've been a good team here um okay so I think now I think first May we're going to give an overview of the policies and procedures and then Arlene could talk about the RO of the HR department and Sophie you could talk about what your specific role would be okay so we all know what everybody's doing and want to reach out to you Bron would you like to go first since you have to leave for an 8:30 I can I can it's fine um sorry I have to leave at 8:30 for another meeting um I just want to give a formal overview of the HR department I know I've been with u this group here for a couple of years and you've seen me in and out throughout the state house but I honestly don't think I've ever had an opportunity to formally introduce myself or talk about the formal introduction of the HR office which is really um I don't know if I can call it new anymore to the general assembly but we're going into our fourth year so we have the the uh Legislative Office of Human Resources was established several years ago under statute and I was brought in as the human resources distor to sort of establish the department and get it off the ground and we're going into year number four which is unbelievable and hard to believe that it's gone back so fast um but under the officite HR and under the statute is it's written we support all of the members of the general assembly and staff in multiple areas um I'll just list off a few so we help with um establishing policies and procedures we provide support and advice and guidance to members and staff we um conduct investigations for staff or anything that involves staff um or even members if it's applicable and when appropriate we provide advice and guidance about investigations and things like that so that sort of transitions over to why HR is sitting here with this panel we also sit with the other HST panel um the other discrimination the Discrimination prevention panel so with the transition and with the new HR office we have been moving the HR work that the other offices have sort of been supporting and conducting themselves without an HR office we've been moving that work over to the HR office and so if you fast forward now we have Maggie's position so she's the HR employment attorney she does our internal um you know legal work she supports all of you just like we do in HR um and she also will be supporting and Staffing the panels as Damien did before from that legal perspective and so if you can talk about the bill drafting which is why she's here um so that's what we're doing from from the HR perspective as far as the staff concerned just to give you like a quick overview the HR office supports the staff in the entire what we call HR life cycle which is everything from recruiting through offboarding when they leave employment and everything in in between so we're a fully established HR office and we help them with training and benefits and Performance Management and everything that you would find in a typical HR office so happy to be here again with you and looking forward to a great session we're really happy and lucky to have a dedicated HR office it's than you yeah it's been great really has okay sopie or Maggie who wants to go next um I go next since this is sort of introductory stuff so I made everybody pack it and this contains um this contains house rule this contains uh the current policy and the current procedures um and I highlighted the house rules so that you know where we are looking okay so this panel is established by house rule 9C which is a part of the um regulation of conduct by the body and it contains all of the stuff for the ethics panel the Discrimination panel sexual harassment panel and just is a very brief overview um I'd like to look at C4 um which is our first bid today El have chair check done adopt procedures to conduct its business um we have that currently although it could always be revised um adopt a policy against sexual harassment in compliance with 21 BSA section 4 95h we also have that um Damian grafted both the statute and a policy so I'm very confident that it is in compliance with that um section five so this panel receives and investigates complaints of alleged sexual harassment against members of the House the speaker's staff or the clerk or her staff so this explicitly doesn't um include other staff so the IT people the HR people ledge Ops all that stuff um I think that that could I I so I think that that is a thing that we should spend some time on this bium and officially moving over staff stuff to a separate policy um but we'll we can get there so right interrupt put something Ain something not know we talk about this already but I'm sorry I was little late we rain into something last year a jurisdictional snap through and I just want want to put a pin that that's on your agenda but we're not we uh we're just only just okay discussing issues that we' not dealt with in the past like moving forward so this number five describes the sort of investigatory and adjudicatory piece of the work that this panel does so this is your neutral um sorting out actual complaints and administering a process to find out what happened um when it comes to regulated individuals um and the other piece in subsection six is about is about um training and advice and potentially advocacy so the way I see it there's kind of two philosophical bases for what this group does one of which is a neutral fact finding and procedural piece and the other is more in the training and advocacy World okay so the next document is the policy for the prevention of sexual harassment um and this states that the panel uh along with the Senate sexual harassment panel has jurisdiction over quote staff from legislative offices that are not specifically dedicated to either chamber that's in the second paragraph on the first page but again I think that's a little bit at odds with the explicit language of both the procedural rules and the house rules so I just think that that's something to think about this vium um and again there's language that says uh the panels investigate and adjudicate complaints in a manner that is fair expeditious and nonpartisan um this is the direction to approach each complaint in a usful manner give respondents the opportunity to respond and be heard I got a lot of experience with this when I worked at ubm and looking at things like what the student conduct office does what the office of people opportunity does um so that's the sort of lens that I look at these things through um a just a question yeah um can you tell me the definition of adjudicate if we adjudicate what do we do that is a great question um so the way that these things work is if a complaint comes to this panel and it's not resolved by informal means as you'll see in the procedures and there is jurisdiction over it so the allegation could be a potential violation of this policy then there's a whole procedure to come to a conclusion and adjudicate and get to a finding right there's a hearing there's an outside investigation and at that point this panel makes a recommendation to the house about the outcome and I think that's the adjudicatory function is saying based on all this evidence based on the investigation based on our um assessment of the evidence in front of us we think that there was a violation of the policy and this is our recommendation for the outcome so that's how I see is okay thank you of course like a judgment right yeah y it sounds like we can only recommend like our ethics training yest today about like centuring member or expulsion of a member that's up to that body so we could recommend to the body if it was something serious enough but they would have to the body would have to vote and I do think and I haven't read those last year but I think we we provided for um our ability to kind of help um facilitate the mar for yes yep so and um we'll get there for sure and I think that that's overwhelmingly what actually happens I think the more important piece of this um okay so the policy identifies the panel uh members as the first points of contact for sexual harassment complaints so you may hear from people who are concerned about something that happened to them or that they witnessed um these people may want to talk about their options and I think it's just important for the panel to be aware that that's part of of what you do is provideing ear for people who are potentially in distress um and and may just have questions you know I saw a thing or something happened un comforable um and then finally I did want to identify the confidentiality piece so it's really important to keep all panel proceedings and inquiries stly confidential unless and until there's a formal hearing and a determination uh again which I think is sort of unlikely to happen but it could um so there's also and I think some of you have experienced with this in the same ping we've put in our discussion um that you could end up in a circumstance because the the complainant and the respondent aren't Bound by confidentiality they can go to the fres and they can talk to whomever they want so you could find yourself in a position where everybody knows about something but you can't say anything which is uncomfortable but it does protect people people's feeling that you are a trusted resource um in regardless of who asks in regardless of what they say you won't say anything and then finally the last document is the um procedures I just yeah know on page seven contact information that I have taken play well there was like everybody else um yeah we should probably add and this is the policy and procedures on the website help yes so yes should be updated it should for sure be updated um yes I believe that well we can get to that so on the procedural document um again I just want to note that a regulated individual is defined as a House member fan and her staff and um the speaker staff excluding other staff and excluding a lot of the people who are protected by this policy so any member of the executive branch or the judicial branch or lobbyists or the public um so in rule two we'll note that anyone can contact the panel to discuss sexual harassment um if the complaintant if the complaint is against a regulated individual you can advise of their panel options um and I think one important thing to have in your brain when you get a complaint is that there are three things that people need to hear um they need to hear that you have to tell the other members of the panel when this happens so if somebody comes to you and says I want to talk to you about something but you can't tell anyone that's not an option you have to at least tell the other members of the panel and you may have have to depending on what they tell you you may have to tell other people too um should be up front with people prely and that's that can be such a hard conversation um so you need to tell them that you need to tell them that the panel may need to gather additional information so you may need to ask some questions to some other people look at some documents um you know I can imagine somebody saying something happened in committee meeting and then watching video of that reported committee meeting or something like that um and then again just let them know that the panel may or may not be able to keep it confidential um okay so the legislature has a legal obligation to stop sexual harassment when it occurs um and if that's just a part of that you don't always have an option you may have to address the situation you may have to take it to yes I'm sorry I'm I just want to back up just a little bit um on the you know the required disclosure P um mandatory oring um so this is work I've done in my my career as well so um it's not at all uncommon for me to have to say to students um as that is coming um that L mandatory recorder y y y um one there's almost always sort of clues or or sort of intuitive I think I where this is going can I stop you I just want to make sure you're this panel I'm not but I do I have either forgotten or don't know who them uh the confidential sources are that we can re them to um so a confidential source so somebody who would definitely not say anything not have to not be required that's a question I know in education context what typically would happen and again you know you're at ubm you're at ubm I was with the state college system but um typically a confidential resource would be someone external like a local domestic violence organization or or something like that where they wouldn't have any obligation to be reporting back but would res close by and they are definitely confidential that's what I meant yeah did you ver HC human rights counil I think that's I think that's something that would have to get worked out with them what those rules would look like because right now as I understand it they don't have jurisdiction yeah over you know over anything that would arise here if they did have jurisdiction then that would change things too because then they would that's just our part of script on campus Because I can say look I think I where this is going I want to make you aware of who I am and what my role is is I also want to help you find the people who might be able have this conversation and more than happy that moment if that would be to I mean yeah so for staff it would be the EAP yeah and that was 100% my answer ABM but again it doesn't numbers aren't powered by can we find that out list people who are close by and um especially if we're in a crisis moment where we want to them connect with that' be really good just saying dropping them feeling sorry human commission is listed as one of the places where people compl it is I think somebody could make a complaint to us but they might not they might want to go somewhere else and staff can if the the question is members and options for people correct I will will definitely look into that and get back to you it's a great one in yeah absolutely anyway so okay um right so I so this is also a place to talk about the anti-retaliation piece so if somebody says okay I would love to talk to you about it but I'm afraid of X Y and Z you can talk to them about the anti-retaliation piece right so participating in anything in an investigation as either a complainant or a witness that person is protected from retaliation by the house rules um and by employment law generally and of course that's not always a good answer for people for lots of reasons but it is I think something important to know and potentially to save people um so if you hear about a potential sexual harass about poti sexual harassment from a witness so somebody comes to you and says I saw something happen to somebody else there is an obligation in these procedures for the panel to reach out to that somebody else and just let them know we heard about a thing would you like to complain here are your options um so that is that's also a piece of this so in rule three as we touched on these are the informal resolution pieces and again this happens much more frequently so pursuing this path does depend on the uh person who is accused of doing something improper consenting to participate in the informal resolution maybe this is a facilitated discussion maybe this is mediation with an outside mediator or it could be a discussion between the panel and this person um but if they don't want to do it they don't have to and then the complainant has to decide well do I want to file a formal complaint or not um and two or more panel members can arrange um to have the mediation or the discussion um there is a provision in here for the panel to gather more information before that happens and I don't think it's a indepth inves ation but it might be something like checking dates or watching a a a meeting if something is recorded so that you don't spend a lot of time at the beginning of a facilitative discussion like well what do you mean it's today it wasn't today and and just preparing oneself and and looking at what's available um before setting up any kind of process so hopefully the informal process is the end of the story and people can get some closure and some resolution from some kind of informal discussion for mediation however if the complainant in rule four decides not to pursue informal action the panel may need to step in on some and this happens when you hear about something that is enough of a concern that it invokes that obligation on behalf of of the legislature and that's what arene and Sophie and I are here for to consult on this stuff they need to do something and it may be you know anywhere from talking to the person even though the complainant says they don't want to be involved to talking to the Capitol Police right and this is entirely a case by casee analysis but just because the complainant doesn't want to do anything doesn't mean there isn't an obligation to address it um and often this is like what if it happens again you know it's that sort of a thing um rule five this is the formal this is the beginning of the formal complaint procedure um if this happens we will go into the whole procedure I don't think it's worth taking time here to talk about but this is always an option for people to BU letter formal complaint and invoke that procedure um it typically involves um an investigation by outside law fir um we don't do that inhouse for a lot of reasons and talk L about having one under we do have one okay we do yep we are all set with that if we need it um and at any time the complaintant can say you know what I I'd like to try the informal process they can always change their mind and sometimes it's positive so finally again um rule 20 confidentiality all records all information all discussions are confidential the only thing here that I want to just point out is that the complainant can grant a limited waiver to discuss with other entities who might have jurisdiction so imagine you want to talk to the ethics panel or imagine you want to talk to the capital police they can grant that limited labor that allows you to do that again if you have enough of a concern with things like of D plan um that is possible and allows for some flexibility in that really pretty rigid confidentiality um requirement so that's all I have the only thing I last thing I wanted to say is that in terms of notice and live streaming for this panel it's at the discretion of the chair um typically fixing the rules and having non-confidential or procedural discussions that might be of interest to the public that's something that you know is encouraged but it's not something that you have to do and there are times when it's in never that's all we have thank you thank you hi thank you question it doesn't look like it's a under 20 but what if you had a situation where you were aware was aware that they have say numerous complaints of someone behing was actually an appropriate way but no one wanted to pursue it and so you don't have a complainant that's willing to give a limited waiver but you do feel that it would be necessary to take action or to or to speak to the capital police about it um that's a great question I mean if you don't have a complainant then you don't have that relationship of confidentiality I guess you would just be sharing with the Capal police several incidents that come to our intention of this person because it's creating a hostile working right and you wouldn't be breaking that sort of obligation to anyone at that point yeah I was just thinking there was like an emergency situation where where you you needed to act but you didn't have a complain it's a very question I don't think you would be bound by confidentiality in that sometimes it's a question of balancing the risk right and sometimes it's better to make a report to avoid a you know crime happening for example than than you know breaching I mean you hope you're not never in that situation this is just what am I bring into yeah oh toally agree and I can confound that I can do a little research and confound that that is interesting I'm saying the same thing because we have that obligations it's just because someone doesn't want to make them does the any we not necessarily obligated to go forward but you also have to confidenti you just don't want to be in a situation where you have information or or after the fact someone's like but the panel knew yeah potential thing why didn't you ask you could have prevented this you know the next thing from happening okay okay um I just I think I found that it's very helpful to look at the dend a the jurisdiction panels there's a chart that sort of go the relationship your years that was that was actually going to be my question so the respondent those are effectively the regulated individuals the ones the panel has jurisdiction and over not not Senators I mean I understand that the Senate panel but that would be although I'm not really clear because on here it's got the office of legislative Council so it would be broader than what you're discussing about with the it's a tension and it's a if I mean the documents just say different things so this says that there is jurisdiction over that but the house rules and the procedure and the definition is very clear that it's only house members house cler her staffs speaker staff and that's what I think need should it ideally get sorted out yeah so this leads to our next yes issue well and if if I were the queen of the world staff issues that are not betsen or Conor and M would be handled as a Personnel matter by HR because I think tels are scary for employees um but that's and that's something we can take out if you want so you just passed out this bill and I Happ to find out last night companion introduced H4 I think already rep already yeah and I didn't know that till last night so I think the discussion was going to be did we want to reintroduce it now it's been reintroduced now Point yeah has introduced yet but it's okay so I we all signed up to that the members of the we had a a realization last year that we the panel did not cover um elected State Statewide officials we had no jurisdiction and that seemed to be a big gap and we went and spoke with the Human Rights Commission and so we're trying to and we decided to come forward with this bill it never got taken up I remember having that conversation and I think you were in the room with HRC with big can you remember was there an appetite for this like did they want to take it on well I think she was sort of let us know how overwhelmed they were with with work um so I think that that could be you know if this B that's taken up I think we can have that so I think that and there's also a bill that um sh the P right now so we have a it was a bill presentation Daman came in and gave a bill presentation were you on the committee last year the house P Stevens committee yeah so um I think that what would be good would be I can ask representative burrow to make the the bill if she hasn't submitted yet she just collecting signatures she right in dting so so I should tell her that I'm assuming don't like to sign on right I wasn't here last you have some background to that on where the situation came up where I mean I think we can discuss that yeah okay yeah um so but I I pres be someone I I can let representative know once it's released to used in very yeah um so that's all that I thought you might want to but maybe somebody has other issues to talk about or questions or anything I guess I have a question how often does this schedule just as need no as need okay yeah I felt like you know since we have the training if you get together now we're all you know we're all set up if there's a complaint we'll have our team ready I'm just going to update my calendar I'll him we have been meeting if we well we've had a lot of meetings when we revised the policy 20 years ago and that was a lot of Friday mornings I if this is a good time for everybody if something comes up that you know maybe we do that we probably maybe find another I don't know we have to drop about within the this is appropriate realm anyway um because it's not sou yeah yeah so depends on what our business is yes exactly I know Room 11 is going to be fre up really soon because we're moving February at some point should be have confence to weend oh right oh okay we we have used 133 State Street near at times um so we that's something that can be work out so thank you everybody willing to be on the panel yeah I hope this quick question did the senator work on this oh yeah they did Senator hon is the chair and I'll let her know that we and you um so is it you you don't work for the Senate it's it's it's um I think presid BL right okay yep so I have what I think is an easy question for you I think for one of you um who but we sometimes have interns college kids mly and then of course they children they who do they go to for a complaint so in the first instance they would go to a doorkeeper or Agatha or yes yes thank you yes just would do that okay interns can go to the legislator with whom they work they can come to the Legislative Office of Human Resources we did a orientation for them to introduce ourselves tell them about this policy and the procedures um so they essentially have the same rules as or resources as staff and it's really who they're most comfortable with they could also go to their people at their University who can then reach back out to their contacts here which is arene and Agatha and me because that may be the person whom they precisely thank you thank you all right thanks everybody

come to order members kindly take their seats will the house please come to order members this morning uh we will uh be uh receiving a sexual harassment prevention training and we are so fortunate to have a fantastic facilitator with us this morning Stacy householder is um leading this training this morning and uh she's from ncsl please give her a warm [Applause] welcome good morning everybody good morning happy 2025 congratulations on the start of session and congratulations to those of you who have just won your very first election and are now part of this very prestigious body my name is Stacy householder I work for the National Conference of State legislatur better known as ncsl and for those of you who don't know ncsl is your National Organization we are the National bipartisan Organization for all state legislators as well as all 25,000 legislative staff that serve the legislative institutions across the country so we are here to support you in many ways including with research and bills but one of the things we do is this we go out into the states to provide professional development to state legislators because nobody teaches you how to do this job you don't get training you can't go to school for it and you learn it on the Fly many times so it is our mission to make sure that uh you are strengthening the institution of the legislature and we are here to provide you with tools to do that so today we're going to be talking about a very important subject that has affected All State legislatures across the country but I hope by the end of it you will see this as more than just compliance training because it is important to protect the Integrity of the institution so before we dive into the nitty-gritty of this particular topic for the next 50 to 60 minutes I'd like you to zoom out and of course we were working before there we go why did you choose to run those of you who are uh returning why did you choose to run for reelection those of you who are brand new why did you choose to run in the first place go ahead and turn to the person uh seated beside you this is going to be interactive today so we'll ask you to talk quite a bit and share your reason share your reason for being here maybe you had a personal experience maybe you have a family Legacy whatever it is for e all right we'll bring it back together and to set the tone off right I'd just like to ask for two volunteers who are willing to share with the body what is their reason for being here so two volunteers who are going to open it up right here thank you for volunteering first my reason for being here is I was asked um and I saw my property taxes go up I want affordability I saw all the vetos were over roote and it really bothered me so I put my head out there I've been retired I've been sitting home so that's why I'm here to hope to bring our taxes down okay thank you for coming how about anybody else how about this side yes go ahead um as a social worker I could help the thousands of people on the individual group and family Lev level my whole career and it would make a difference but I realized if I did that and changed the policy that affects the conditions um that the social and physical environment then I could amplify my efforts since Ian great you all have these individual reasons for being here and let me tell you the legislative staff who are dedicated to this institution also have their own reasons for being here they received this training yesterday so you're you are all here to serve the citizens of Vermont and we ask that question because the only way that you will be able to accomplish those individual goals as well as the collective goals of the body is if you can operate in a respectful environment and A legislature is a very different kind of workplace but it is a workplace nonetheless you come here to get something done so over the 50 years that ncsl has been in existence we have surveyed many legislators and we have come up with this definition of what a respectful legislature should strive to be and I'm just going to highlight some of the key terms here but this idea that legislative uh those involved with legislative business are treated fairly all differences and values are acknowledged communication is open and civil sometimes we we really kind of see a lack of that with things get tense in the legislative environment conflict is addressed early and there is this idea of a culture of cooperation so that's always a strive sometimes we don't always quite meet that Mark but it's something to keep in mind so of course the magic question is how do you create that environment so next I'd like anybody who is returning you have been in the legislature before I'd like you to just stand this is not your first session okay and I'd like you to think about this question when you were here in the past we've done this training for you before so hopefully it's a little bit familiar what is one thing that you did perhaps last session or perhaps before that to cultivate respect what is something that you walk into this magnificent building every day and try to do as an individual to make sure that this is a respect respectful Place does anyone want to volunteer something they try to do every day what do I see right over here I'm out of practice clearly um I make efforts um to go up to folks who are new and um see how they're doing if they need anything um and just kind of introduce myself and help out when I can I think it's important because sometimes folks are you know deer in a headlights when they first come in and it can be helpful to have someone come up to you and and ask how they're doing right create a welcoming environment all right you can all sit down thank you so much uh you know what's next all of you who are brand new go ahead and stand up we want to hear what you have to say too you're you don't know what you've gotten yourself into yes right and I'm sure you've heard the stories from all of your colleagues in the room but this will be quite an experience for you one that hopefully you will remember forever and ever in your life and will be incredibly rewarding but I'd like to ask you this question what expectations do you have both of yourself and of your colleagues in the room to make this first year for you respectful what expectations do you come walk in the door having for yourself and your colleagues does anyone have has anyone thought about that or want to share their thoughts yes go ahead I have an expectation to give respect and be respected I try to I tried to meet the legislators from around the state of all parties and I asked them what do you do when you're not here and I explain to them what I do so we can all have empathy for each other we may not agree on policy but we can learn to understand why the other person thinks the way they do yeah that's that's an excellent point thank you you can all sit down uh that's a wonderful point because what you do your family your educational background all of that influences the values that you all walk in the door with and everybody walks in with different values because of their life experiences none are better or worse than any other value so it's important to remember that and get to know people on that human level but of course in the thick of things when policy is getting tense and debate is getting tense and you're running up against deadlines we sometimes run into this idea of lack of respect people get frustrated people get tense and we there are these things called derailers right what are some behaviors or activities or sayings or comments that could derail respect in the leg legislature anyone want to throw some out there's a couple hints on the photos on the screen what are a couple derailers of respect just call them out dishonesty is probably the biggest one dishonesty yep any others coffee in the house chamber okay right right decorum right we gotta keep keep on with decorum any others shaming that's right there's a whole list of them right yelling bullying gossiping using profanity and shooting on someone's personal or private space spreading rumors name calling offensive jokes demeaning comments abuse of authority innuendo or taunting racial slurs derogatory nicknames insulting gestures these are all things that we talk about when we're five years old and in grade school right and somehow when we become adults we seem to sometimes forget about these things when topics become tense So today we're going to talk about tactics on how to remember those and also how harassment can manifest in the legislative environment because derailers exist all legislators and legislative staff have a policy in Vermont that covers harassment and sexual harassment and when I say you are covered by it that means that you are meant to abide by that policy I'll show you where you can find it and I hope that you uh take a look at it read it familiarize yourself with it and know the standard that you are being held to however another important note is that those who use the capital for business such as the media lobbyists Advocates constituents when they walk in the building they are also protected by that policy that you have in place and here you can see where you can find it it's um it's on the sexual harassment prevention panel committee page and then there's a link to it as well and we'll share this PowerPoint but do take a read familiarize yourself with what it says so that you know you're going to see a couple of definitions that are straight from your policy those are going to be shown on the the black background screens up here I want to run through those just so we all have a baseline I won't go through the whole policy but I want to highlight some important key terms that you should be aware of the first one is that of harassment and what is it it is a form of discrimination and it is unwelcome conduct based on a protected characteristic sexual harassment which is also defined in your policy is a form of discrimination and it is based on sex sexual orientation or gender identity sexual harassment in the workplace is illegal and all of you as elected officials have a duty to protect the institution and create that respectful environment again we see this worm word unwell welcome which is key to harassment so in sexual harassment unwelcome sexual advances requests for sexual favors and other conduct of a sexual nature when it is made either implicitly or explicitly a term of employment or the conduct has the purpose of creating an intimidating hostile or offensive work environment and that can be for other legislators it can also be for legislative staff and those other folks that I listed as protected one other thing I want to mention in particular is that it can take many forms it can be verbal physical auditory visual or any kind of combination there is thereof and it may be subtle or overt so you have to be really aware how your conduct might affect other people in working on this topic with State legislatures since about 2017 we consulted with a sexual harassment lawyer his name is Jonathan seagull and he has put together a framework that I think is really helpful in thinking about how sexual harassment manifests in a state legislature in particular so I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to him for just a short clip I've broken this down into four categories and they're fluid and they factors including power that can move which category something's in I want to be really clear that all four categories of behavior are [Music] unacceptable category one would be unil or abusive Behavior assuming it's not based on or directed at someone because of their sex race religion age disability you won't have the respect that goes with the service if you're abusive and disrespectful assuming that it's the same type in degree may not be unlawful but it's really unacceptable and it is the potential Gateway when you're yelling and screaming or abusing people from that it's more likely that harassing conduct of a sexual racial ethnic religious Behavior just examples could occur the second category is what I would say harassing Behavior but if you look to case law might not be severe or pervasive enough to be unlawful for a hostile work environment to exist among other factors needs to be severe or pervasive sexual harassment could be gender bias comments even if they're not sexual in nature stereotyping about women or perhaps men both would be equally wrong but one is more likely to happen than the other there's nothing funny about making fun of someone's gender their pregnancy their age their disability their sexual orientation um a joke in of itself of that nature is probably not unlawful but it's unacceptable a comment on appearance you look sharp today maybe okay you look sexy never okay you look attractive some might hear sharp some might hear sexy I'd probably stay away someone saying once you look sexy one Lear one gawk probably not enough to be unlawful enough to say I'm not going to accept it I'm not going to engage in it if I see it I'm going to respond to it the third would be unlawful on its face and that would be the tangible employment action sometimes called quid proquo I know no Latin except for this this for that so that would mean a legislator uh um might say to a lobbyist if you want me to support this you're going to need to sleep with [Music] me then the fourth category would be criminal sexual assault perhaps a hate crime because of race those are things that go beyond um civil liability but could be criminal so category one abusive yelling and screaming and cursing and nonsexual ways Category 2 would be sexually or otherwise harassing but not severe or pervasive enough to be unlawful category three probably harassment in of itself such as demanding sex for a promotion or a vote or category 4 criminal assault or perhaps even attempted assault so I want to make clear that the these are not legal terms necessarily but I do think it is a helpful framework to think of all of the great areas in which we might see or experience harassment and sexual harassment in a legislative environment two things I want to point out that Jonathan touched on one is this idea of intent versus impact and we're going to have a chance to play around with these in just a minute but this idea of intent versus impact is that welcomeness of a certain action Behavior comment whatever it might be is determined by the recipient of that behavior not by the person engaging in that behavior so you might be in a crowd someone might make a questionable joke and if the person on the receiving end of that joke finds it offensive they have the right to determine that even if the person telling the joke says oh I didn't mean any harm by that you took it the wrong way that's not what I meant that does not really matter what matters is the impact that those comments or behaviors or actions had on the people who were in the group or the bystanders who overheard that conversation the other thing that I want to point out is Jonathan mentioned this idea for category 2 harassment must be severe or pervasive and while that is true in federal law and in some other states Vermont actually has a higher standard than that Vermont does not require conduct to rise to the level of severe or pervas in order to be considered harassment if you are not sure whether something you've experienced could be harassment remember that any unwelcome sexual conduct that exceeds a petty slight or an inconvenience could be considered potential harassment so keep that in mind because Vermont law is just slightly different in that way now we're going to get a chance to put these um uh categories into practice and we're going to see how uh sexual harassment manifests in legislatures across the us so you all have a handout it's called discussion guide in front of you I'm going to give you about five or six minutes you have six scenarios on this document and you're going to answer the question is this harassment yes no or maybe and if you think it is harassment which category would you put it in and why so go ahead work with the person next to you have have a discussion these are all real life examples from legislators and I want you to answer those two questions about each one so go ahead take the next five minutes and do that let me know if you need a copy okay there you go there you go you need another one yes of course there's one there's two there you go anybody else a chance the whole thing about crial behavior and uh I've got a death threat and there's a I totally agree with the intent get to deide but that's not how it's working out in the court because of the first amendment protection okay yeah yeah we can talk about that after the fact and we also have um the legal counsel here who can provide some thoughts on that too so for that's for for take two more minutes to finish up for okay let's bring it back together we're going to run through these so we can discuss them as a group and all be on the same page you are welcome to toss out any questions that you might have any thoughts that you and your partner had while going through these uh but let's go through the first one together a legislator shakes a step staff's hand and says good morning the staffer files a claim of sexual harassment they do not like to be touched in any manner so how we're going to do this is if you think it is harassment I will ask you to give me a thumbs up which I know might seem counterintuitive but that's just the way we're going to do it if you do not think it's harassment give me a thumbs down and if you're a maybe you're G to kind of give me a thumb in the middle here and then we'll go into what category you think it is so what do you think about this one shaking hands is this harassment yes no maybe okay I'm seeing mostly NOS around the room and yes I would agree with you in this particular instance it is not harassment because this is a normal custom in the workplace it's a normal custom in American culture now a couple caveats on this one and then I'll come back to you for your question uh if you're just meeting that person maybe for the first or second time and you don't know that that's a very traditional thing to do no problem the the staffer in this case does have the right of course to say oh thank you really nice to meet you you know I I don't really shake hands or I'm getting over an illness or whatever the situation might be if someone knows a particular thing about a person like you've met this staff for multiple times maybe it's your committee Aid or something like that and you repeatedly are trying to touch them or shake their hands then we start getting into a typical pervasive environment so again this is just a matter of self-awareness and being aware of those around you we have a question over here okay great yep all right any questions about that one all right let's jump into number two a staffer has filed a complaint of sexual harassment against another staffer that serves as a committee assistant to a committee after they have left their committee assistant role to work in another Staff office the committee assistant and committee chair the legislator think the claim name is bogus and have instructed the committee members and other committee assistants not to communicate with the staffer or with anyone in the office where they now work what do you think is this harassment yes no or maybe for those of you with a thumbs up I would agree with you this is harassment anyone want to take a guess why yeah the creation of a hostile work environment it is the creation of a hostile work en other reasons say it again yes yep that's right retaliation we're going to talk quite a bit more about retaliation and a little bit later what category would you put this in if you were looking at these the Jonathan categories that he went over and again not legal but what would you think one two three or four okay we have a lot of twos this technically goes into category three for one reason and one reason only and that is because retaliation is unlawful so anything that borders or is retaliation is unlawful you cannot do it in any workplace if someone files a complaint of harassment or sexual harassment okay number three a legislator sends several sexually inappropriate text me messages to a lobbyist who welcomes these messages the lobbyist forwards the text messages to to other lobbyists and one of them complains to the media no one wants to be in this situation right let's just stipulate that right off the bat so what do you think yes no or maybe is this harassment we have yes and no and and in a in a way you're both right and I'll tell you why so there's two different situations going on in this one scenario that I've given you so let's talk about the first sentence first the legisla is sending several sexual inappropriate text messages to a lobbyist the lobbyist is welcoming those messages this gets a little bit tricky when you talk about legislative environment is it inappropriate yeah it is this is an inappropriate message now the lobbyist is welcoming this message so whether or not you have sexual harassment here is a question and it gets a little bit tricky there the second part of um of the equation is a little bit different story the lobbyist forwards the text messages to other lobbyists and one of them complains to the media this is something that is outside the legislature's jurisdiction because it's lobbyist to lobbyist however if the lobbyist is forwarding something and it is it could be unwelcome from the other lobbyist and in this case it certainly was because one of them went to the media and complained about it and and really outed this whole series of things so there are really two different situations that are happening in this one and even though you know lobbyists are protected by the policy that is in place um they are not necessarily covered by it so any questions about that one yeah thank you um I was wondering if we were assessing what the legislator did or what the lobbyist who sent the messages did and so if you could just with respect to the mo the issue you raised about being covered by some I I just was curious we could talk about that a little more because I was confused yeah I I would say that what the legislator is doing is covered by the policy because the legislator is engaging in the activity so and then the welcomeness or not is a separate question so it is inappropriate behavior that is happening and let's let's say the lobbyist was not comfortable with those type of text messages then the policy would absolutely come into play because the legislator is covered and expected to abide by the policy and the lobbyist is protected under your policy and say the presence or absence of a quidd pro quo would then apply to the categorization of yes yeah and again those C these categories are fluid and so it context really affects where something might fall but in that case let's assume the lobbyist did not welcome those things I would probably put that in around a category two yeah I'm curious if the lobbyist can truly welcome or consent to the message given the unequal power Dynamic yeah it's a great point we're going to talk about power dynamics in a minute but something that all legislators need to be aware of is simply by virtue of being elected to the position you are in there is an unequal power Dynamic that exists in this building and outside of this building people are deferential to you no matter what constituents legislative staff lobbyists anyone who's just coming in to do business in the capital will be deferential to you as a legislator and I know sometimes that's that's hard to hear you know I work I worked for a legislature for a long time and he was like just call me Allen I just want to be Allen to everybody right but he he's not he's not just Allen he's Senator because that is is who you are it's what comes with the fact of being elected so I think it's really important to remember that in all of the interactions that you have all right let's go to number four a representative tells a sexually explicit joke to a senator in front of other legislators what do you think yes no or maybe see a lot of yeses couple maybe here yep yeah I I would put this certainly in the it's in the maybe and I would would lean yes so I would kind of put it here again the um the question of welcomeness is at stake here is it inappropriate yes for sure we can say that so we know kind of for sure it's in category one and then it's are these other legislators welcoming of these type of jokes these type of comments the other thing you have to remember in this particular circumstance is let's assume it's just right out here in the hallway you could have lots of other people who are walking around you could have legislative staffers who are overhearing that conversation and that can then create a hostile work environment if someone is overhearing these conversations over and over all right number five a legislative staffer is expecting a baby A legislature stops her in the hall to congratulate her and the following conversation ensues the legislator says congratulations how far along are you and the staffer says thank you so much I'm 7even months and the legislator says wow that baby must be huge my daughter was much smaller than you at seven months the stav is not having a great day at work this day right and I think that this one in particular is we're going to talk about intent versus impact with this but what did you think did you think this is harassment yes no or maybe okay we're in the like maybe the yes category and that's where I am too it sort of maybe a yes and the reason is because protect pregnancy is a protected class so let's talk first about intent versus impact with this one and that is this idea that the legislator probably did not mean anything negative by this it wasn't malicious in intent it was just sort of an off-the-cuff comment that probably didn't make the staff or feel all that great right and so even though the intent it was not negative or bad certainly the impact of that comment could have an effect on someone the other thing that we don't know here even if this is a one-off comment from the legislator what if this staffer had received three other comments about her pregnancy in that same day from other people around the building then you start to have a hostile work environment because of a physical condition that someone has so you you kind of have to remember all of that and and just stay away from comments on appearance you know if we're giving advice here that's a good one to just stay away from any comments on appearance any questions about this one okay and let's look at the last one a and this is purposely I don't give you a lot of context on this one a legislator sends flowers to a staffer what do you think yes no or maybe yeah let everybody body's pretty much in the maybe category here and you're right what what would make this not harassment we got go ahead so if it was thank you so much for all the work you did last night at our hearing yeah I know you're really into flowers and thought this would brighten up your desk right appreciation yep any other situations where this might not be harassment yeah go ahead a death in the family right easy easy one okay you lost your mother I'm G to send I'm going to give you flowers because I'm carrying right we don't want to take Humanity out of the workplace but we do want to be aware to your point earlier sir we want to be aware that everybody has different values and they um they handle situations very differently so it's more about self-awareness and being aware of what people appreciate around you now what would make this harassment is if this is a flirtation and if this is a continued flirtation so if you know a dozen roses is showing up every other day that's a problem and if part in particular if the staffer has asked for this Behavior to stop or indicated that they are uncomfortable with this scenario then that would move it into the yes category and it becomes harassment any questions around this one well thanks everybody for for doing that exercise I think it's helpful to see what situations have happened in other legislatures and how they might happen in uh in Vermont so now you know what if something does happen What do you do then and this is the reporting process that you have for the house you have a lot of options of what you can do if you are um the recipient or victim of harassment or if you happen to be a bystander and witness harassment the first one that I like to talk about is that you could directly approach the person that you think is in the wrong right if you have a comfortable enough relationship with them you can pull them aside privately and just say hey I think that joke you told is not appropriate for the legislative environment I want to make sure that we're having a respectful workplace that everyone feels comfortable I'd appreciate it if you didn't say comments like that anymore you do not have to do that if you are not comfortable approaching the person you do not have to approach them and you could use one of these other methods other Methods at your disposal you could contact your office of human resources and we have a couple of folks uh who are here from that office today you could contact the appropriate sexual harassment panel that you have in the house the members or the chairs staff have the option of contacting their supervisor here in Vermont and then you have a couple other resources at your disposal the EEOC the Vermont uh Human Rights Commission the Vermont attorney general and the state ethics commission as well some of those have some timelines that are associated so you know that they have a a period of when you can report to them or not now that we have talked about what harassment is and what it can look like in the legislative environment let's talk about what harassment is not harassment is not a difference of opinion or normal disagreement on policy in fact I hope you're doing that on a daily basis you are a deliberative body that is what you're here for so as long as it is happening in a respectful way that is not harassment giving feedback or following up on poor performance so this you know mostly kind of applies to the staff here but if someone's just giving feedback or saying hey I think we could improve X Y or Z that is not harassment and enforcing the rules and policies that you have in place as long as those rules and policies are are enforced in a fair and equal manner now there are some risk factors that are inherent in the structure of legislatures that make them more ripe for harassment than other workplace environments these come from the EEOC and I want to point out three of them that exist in legislatures because if you're aware of them you can mitigate against them so the first one is this idea of power disparity or power dynamics as we talked about you all walk in the door with a power disparity because people will be differential to you so you really have to be aware of that when interacting with staff when interacting with lobbyists when interacting with constituents keep that in mind the other risk factor is social events a lot of business in the legislature gets done outside the walls of this building receptions dinners events whatever out on the road whatever it might be often times there's alcohol at those particular activities and we see people Behaving Badly sometimes when alcohol is involved certainly behaving in ways where they might not behave in a professional setting and last but not least legislatur tend to have young staff around whether it's someone's first job out of school or like you have here you have young pages and interns who are around often times these folks have never been in a professional environment before they don't know what is right and what is wrong they need mentorship right and we often see young staff getting taken advantage of because they just don't know what harassment is or what it can look like so be aware of that I want to focus a bit as we wind down here I want to focus a bit on this idea of bystander intervention because this is most prevalent in legislatures it is more likely that you will witness something or you will be a bystander to bad behavior and so it's important to know what could you do in that situation most people do nothing and I think that's sometimes why we have Perpetual problems in state legis"
"atures so what is a bystander a bystander is a person who is present when an event takes place but they are not directly involved bystander intervention is used to describe a situation where someone who is not directly involved steps in to change the outcome of that particular situation so why don't people do this more often it seems like it's very obvious you know if you see wrong bad behavior you would step in you would want to stop it in a legislative setting that's very hard to do and believe me I know that because I've worked in legis in and around legislatures for almost 20 years right you might have spent a very long time cultivating a relationship with someone that you need in order to get things done you might see them doing bad behavior and it can be very hard to confront them and to jeopardize that relationship I get that I understand it we did a survey and these are some of the other reasons we heard about why people do not step in I don't know what to do or say it's not my business someone else will step in um you know it might be my boss or my colleague I'm not comfortable doing it even though these are very very natural responses to have I would say as an elected official and in your position it is your duty to step up and say something whether that's approaching the person directly whether it's going to leadership for support whatever it might be it is your duty to make sure that this continues to be um a institution that is worthy of the name and certainly worthy of the service that you've dedicated to so we ALS I want to give you four ways that you can intervene if you are a bystander so these are real tools that you can put in your toolbox to intervene and we call them the 4ds so the first thing you can do is be direct we've talked about that just pull the person aside tell them directly you don't appreciate what they're doing again that depends on your relationship with them you can distract you can engage with the person and just try to change the subject just go another way right you could delegate if you're not comfortable talking to them you can go to other resources for support and have them talk to that person on your behalf or you could delay if you're unable to intervene right in that particular moment you could pull the recipient aside after the fact and just say hey that conversation felt a little uncomfortable to me how are you doing is there anything you'd like me to do can I support you in any way these are all options that you have a lot of times you'll do multiple of these in one interaction but they're tools for you to use to move on we're going to skip this quick and we're going to go straight to a scenario that we have for bystanders during a private meeting between legislators and staff a senior legislator repeatedly interrupts a junior staff member with dismissive comments like we're not here to hear about your feelings when the staff member tries to contribute at one point the legislator jokes you're much better at taking notes and sharing ideas maybe stick to that the tone and remarks have a clear gendered implication and the staff member looks embarrassed and silenced other participants including you notice the exchange in the room becomes tense but no one speaks up likely because of the legislator's seniority so turn to the person next to you and war game this out what D would you potentially use in this scenario if you found yourself in this small meeting would you be direct with your colleague could you distract delegate or delay so turn to the person next to you have a short conversation about what you might do all right let's bring it back together who wants to share what they said that they would do any volunteers look around yes back here go ahead uh that's a direct hit him between the horns on that one tell them that's a nogo yeah say don't treat them like that right yep any did anybody else have any other thoughts yeah uh we had kind of a conversation between direct and delegating uh because direct you might embarrass the staff member even more by making the whole situation about them and so by delegating maybe outside of the meeting you avoid that situation yeah yeah you can kind of address it privately yeah absolutely all right good one Let's uh this is if we're going back to kind of our categories that we've talked about this would fall into category one one this person's you know really just being a jerk and not professional in this environment but if it's repeated if you're having these meetings a lot it can start to create a hostile work environment so let's do one more during a legislative networking event a legislator places their hand on the lower back of a legislative staffer while leaning in too closely to talk the staffer steps away slightly but the legislator repeats the behavior lat lat in the evening the staffer appears uncomfortable but doesn't say anything possibly because of the power dynamics in the room as a bystander you witness this interaction and notice the staffer discomfort again talk to your neighbor what would you do in this situation if you found yourself here what would you do take 30 seconds to talk about it for okay all right let's do a quick debrief of this one did you have your hand up here did you want to volunteer what you would do I think it'd be important to distract first and then perhaps delegate later you know because you want to step in to save the person that's being accosted but you don't really want to necessarily make a scene especially if this is at a drinking event right exactly yeah maybe pull the staff or the legislator and say oh hey I need you for something else over here whatever it might be who else anybody else have anything else they said something different no everyone would take that approach yeah right over here I said it was good what she said so I will report for my partner um so she said that she might speak to the staffer um as an like afterwards and just say hey I noticed that yeah and um how do you feel and do you need any of my help and then we noted that like often um one person might witness one inappropriate or on you know on edge thing middle of the way thing and if it never gets chronicled like it doesn't matter that 500 people have also seen the thing it's so it is important to kind of keep track and so maybe reporting it to somebody and just saying hey I noticed this it was it made me a little uneasy um you know so maybe like our ethics panel or so yeah absolutely it's good yeah good idea to check in with the person afterwards you know what's going on there so quick debrief of this one this this would technically be category one but certainly bordering right on category two because it was at least repeated at least twice that evening definitely could start to create a hostile work environment even if you're outside the walls of this building you are expected to abide by that policy that you do have in place so let's let's keep that in mind uh in many situations we find uh legislators are much more comfortable being direct with one another than certainly like a staffer would be with you right staffers are less likely to be direct but you guys are all much more comfortable being direct with each other so here are a couple of examples of direct responses that you could use if you need something to say to someone you could say something short and sharp like oh ouch that was harsh this is a little passive aggressive but it might get the point across just to at least stop the behavior you could emphasize the impact that it has on you say you know what that comment did not land well with me even if it it's not directed at you and it would stop that line of questioning you could affirm their intentions well I'm sure you didn't mean it in the way that I just heard it you know and kind of ask them to to repeat it or give them a little heads up like I'm sure you didn't just mean what came out of your mouth uh ask them to explain their views I didn't understand that joke that you just made could you explain it to me that that one can get a little questionable only use that one very sparingly um and then connect the issue to specific people you know I have a friend who belongs to that particular community and the way you're talking about it doesn't sit well with me I have a daughter who thinks this way or believes this and you know so you could point out how it is personally impacting you these are all examples of direct responses that you could have our last definition of the day we talked a little bit about it during the uh scenarios that we deep but it is this idea of retaliation we know that there is massive Under reporting of harassment and sexual harassment in state legislators because of the fear of retaliation this is why widely known workplace retaliation is when a person takes a negative action against someone who either files a complaint of harassment or cooperates with an investigation both are illegal you cannot retaliate in any way someone who files a complaint or is cooperating with an investigation whether as a witness or whatever their capacity might be so this is a really important important topic to keep in mind retaliation can be overt it can often be very subtle in a legislative setting but this is typically where legislators tend to find themselves in trouble is it's because they've allowed retaliation to happen so let's look at an example of retaliation a staffer files a formal complaint against a legislator for inappropriate text messages and persistent sexual advances after the complaint becomes known the staffer begins to receive negative performance evaluations for the first time in their career despite no significant changes in their work quality Additionally the Stafford learns through colleagues that the legislature is spreading rumors about their competence and professionalism suggesting that the staffer only filed the complaint to get attention so I think we can all agree that this is retaliation but I'd like you to take 30 seconds talk to your neighbor about why this is retaliation so go ahead take 30 seconds and we'll debrief it okay let's bring it back together I'm GNA ask for two final volunteers please share what you and your partner talked about why do you think this is retaliation two final people who get to speak today what are you thinking why do you think this is retaliation got someone up are you pointing to someone okay you you have been nominated to speak all right well I mean I I think that that's very clearly retaliation yeah if if if the uh uh staffers uh work habits and quality hadn't changed but the the outcome or or evaluation thereof did um I think what's almost SC is that there are all sorts of ways that that same Stafford could be retaliated against that are not so blatant yeah and I don't know how how One deals with that right and I think it's important that if you're noticing a difference in treatment that it's important to kind of step up and say something about that too because retaliation is illegal and and it is a problem for legislators and you're right it is often very subtle and any other comments why and for what reasons is this retaliation anybody else want to comment on this I'll put a couple other reasons up there one you know obviously spreading rumors to discredit the individual just spreading rumors as a form of harassment anyway unexplained change in performance evaluation and even maybe when the staff are asked about it they're not getting a clear response at the end of the day retaliation is anything that is making it more difficult for someone to do their job after they filed the complaint so if there are any barriers that are put in place that is typically the kind of Baseline of retaliation and what what in the legal world we we use as that so be aware of that just be on the lookout for any kind of retaliation and just know that if someone files a complaint you cannot do it so we're at the end here I really appreciate you've all been very participatory and I started out by saying that Hope by the end of this you'll see this is more than just compliance training because I I truly believe it is well I understand it is compliance I do believe that the institution deserves your attention and your respect on this because there are far-reaching consequences for legislators who allow harassment to happen first for those who are harassed they have a higher level of stress they certainly have more emotional and physical issues higher Health costs and they struggle to just come to work and do their job and that's really all they want to do is to come and serve the people for people who are the harassers you face punishment you could face legal lawsuits um you could face a lot of missed opportunities on the legislator side and the staff side you might miss a promotion you might miss out on a chairmanship because you have this reputation of having bad behavior and then for me someone who's worked in and for legislator for a long time for legislatur that have a harassing reputation you tend to have low morale you have high turnover and you will not attract the best and the brightest both on the legislator side and the staff side if you have the reputation of being a negative place to work and you want the best and the brightest and the most diverse point of view to serve the people of Vermont so I hope that you also join me in seeing this as more than just compliance but you see it as protecting the institution that you are here to serve so I will end by saying thank you and by asking you when you walk out the door today to identify one small thing that you can do each and every day to make this place just a little bit more respectful maybe it's reaching out across the aisle to uh to a counterpart who you don't know all that well getting to know them as a person maybe it's taking a new member under your wing and wanting to show them the ropes right maybe it's just getting to know the legislative staff and what makes them tick and how they want to help you but it's just one small thing you can do each and every day to raise the level of Integrity of the institution so thank you very much I'll Stick Around down here if you have any questions but appreciate it and wish you the best of luck with session sure""",,,,,,,,,,

today's session we're going to understand what sexual harassment in the workplace looks like in all of its varying forms um and hopefully you'll gain some real Clarity on the full range of behaviors that legally constitute sexual harassment in the UK um and many of these actually might come as a surprise to you um we're going to learn about the change in law brought about by the worker protection act and think about and talk about exactly how this change in law impacts on both employee rights and also employer responsibilities we're going to explore some real case studies um so we'll be sharing some real world real world examples of UK sexual harassment cases um that ended up at employment tribun and as we talk through these cases we're going to be um highlighting the risk factors that were identified um at the tribunals um in these cases and we hope that as we go through these risk factors it will start you thinking about some of the risks in your own workplaces that relate to sexual harassment um and we'll finish by providing you with some information um about our preventing sexual harassment at work training session um which has been designed to to support you in becoming compliant with the worker protection act 2023 so what is sexual harassment at work to start with um let's have a look at the definition of sexual harassment in law so sexual harassment is defined in the equality act 2010 and it's defined as unwanted conduct of a sexual nature um which has the purpose or effect of either violating the complainant's dignity or creating an intimidating hostile degrading humiliating or offensive environment for the complainant so that's a legal definition and it can be found in the equality act um 2010 and it's the equality act 2010 that makes an employer legally liable for the conduct of its employees in the course of their employment in relation to sexual harassment and the key word to really focus on in the definition of sexual harassment is unwanted so when we're talking um about sexual harassment we're talking about conduct which is unwanted Uninvited and where there is an absence of consent from the person who receives that behavior or witnesses that behavior and another thing to be really mindful of um it's really important to note that it's the intent behind the behavior um that is important when it comes to sexual harassment so the intent behind the behavior is actually irrelevant when it comes to the legal definition of sexual harassment so conduct does not have to have been intended to cause harm to constitute sexual harassment it's the impact and effect of the behavior um that is important and this is why it's really crucial for employers to take uh their responsibility in relation to preventing sexual harassment of their employees seriously so employers should be taking reasonable steps to make sure that their employees are aware of what behaviors actually constitute sexual harassment um what behaviors make people feel uncomfortable at work um because simply saying that somebody didn't mean to cause harm with their behavior won't act as a justifiable defense if you have a case of sexual harassment which ends up at employment tribunal um so it's really important that you're making people aware of these behaviors um and that they do constitute sexual harassment and that is an employer's responsibility and it's also important to note that for the purposes of this law the workplace will extend to incidences which happen online between employees um even if these interactions happen on personal social media platforms outside of work hours and it ALS also extends to workplace socials and such as Christmas parties and after workor drinks and this they count in these in these contexts even if they're not formally organized by the employer so it could be a group of colleagues going out after work of their own accord um and the conduct there will still count as conduct in the workplace um so what the scope uh for what constitutes the workplace in relation to this law is very Broad so moving on what is the worker protection act 2023 um the worker protection act 2023 is an amendment to the equality act 2010 and it's a legislative change which marks a shift in how workplace harassment is addressed so it places more responsibility on employers to proactively prevent harassment not just respond to reports of sexual harassment and before this change in law um employers were legally required to respond to reports of sexual harassment in the workplace but under the new law employers must be taking reasonable steps um at all times to actually prevent sexual harassment of its employees during the course of their employment um so it's that move from response to proactive prevention so just to outline the law for you it is employer a must take reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment of employees of a in the course of their employment um and that's not all reasonable steps that was actually taken out as it went through um the parliament process um but yet you must be taking reasonable steps so this law is actually now in forced and it has been since the 26th of October this year um meaning that employers should be taking action now to be compliant with this law and in terms of non-compliance with the law um the law will be enforced through employment tribunals um so if a case of sexual harassment is taken to a tribunal and it's judged that reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment have not been taken by an employer an employer could face up to a 25% uplift in employee compensation for that sexual harassment case um which could be a huge financial impact the law will also be enforced by the equality in Human Rights Commission um through their existing mechanisms and it must be noted that an employee can bring a case to um the equality and Human Rights Commission without an incident of sexual harassment occurring so so providing that they have enough evidence that their employer is not taking reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment of employees um they can take that case to the equality and Human Rights Commission so um this law can actually be enforced without a case um of sexual harassment actually happening too and the equality and Human Rights Commission have published guidance in relation to becoming compliant with the worker protection act um which would be an essential read if you're looking to do the work in this area um and we're sure as we begin to see cases being taken to tribunal under the work of protection act we'll hear that equality and Human Rights Commission guidance referenced a lot um in in the tribunals I think I saw someone raise the hand for a question um but I can't quite see who so I'll carry on um and if you want to put pop you question in the chat um we'll definitely make sure it gets answered as best as we can um so what it does sexual harassment at work actually look like um as I mentioned earlier it's really important that in order to prevent uh sexual harassment in the workplace and become compliant with this new law um employers should ensure that their employees understand what constitutes sex ual harassment at work um it will not be an acceptable defense um or justification to say that somebody didn't understand that their behavior constituted sexual harassment or that they didn't mean any harm by it and that the intent wasn't there um because the behavior will still constitute sexual harassment so educating your employees on what sexual harassment is actually constitutes a reasonable step to preventing sexual harassment and would mean that you are more to be judged to be compliant with the work of protection act so we're going to run through some examples of behaviors um which have been judged to constitute sexual harassment in law um and these are the kinds of examples that you should be sharing with your employees when you're raising awareness of the different forms of sexual harassment in the workplace um to support them in understanding all of the different forms of sexual harassment so on this pyramid that I've created um you can see the different examples of behaviors all of which have been judged to constitute sexual harassment in UK law obviously this isn't an exhaustive list um and there's plenty of other examples that we could have used in this pyramid today plenty of examples that you can share in your workplace to raise awareness of this but at the bottom of the pyramid um we have things like asking questions about someone's sex life so for some people this would not make them feel uncomfortable at all um but for other people this would make them feel really uncomfortable and this would constitute sexual harassment we also have making jokes about someone's sex life or their dating life um or making jokes about someone's gender their sexual orientation or gender reassignment we have the use of innuendos so use of innuendos in the workplace doesn't have to have been targeted at someone in the workplace to constitute sexual harassment it can actually um be sexual harassment to anybody who witnesses um the use of that inuendo um because this might make them feel uncomfortable even if they just witness it in the workplace we also have um making sexual remarks about someone's body clothing or appearance um and even makinging sexual or degrading comments about celebrities and the media or people who are not employees at your work um within the work environment so in order for something to be sexual harassment it doesn't have to be directed at somebody in the workplace um again as I mentioned because spectating or being witness to such conversations of a sexual nature can make other colleagues in the workplace feel uncomfortable and this also constitutes sex sexual harassment as well um moving further up the pyramid um we have behaviors like outing someone as being LGBT um at work or sexualizing um LGBT sexual um sexuality um we have asking someone to have um a sexual relationship with you in the workplace unwanted flirting or persistently asking someone on a date after they've said no we also have touching someone against their will and this can include hugging them um or touching their waist or body as you move past them again some people are really comfortable with hugging colleagues and it's a way that they kind of like comfort each other and express friendship um but we must be mindful that this isn't everybody this isn't how everybody feels um and it can constitute sexual harassment at work also on that middle of the pyramid we have staring um staring can be done with very malicious intent to make someone feel very uncomfortable and intimidated but it can also be done without malicious intent at all again reiterating regardless of intent staring could constitute sexual harassment because it's the effect of staring that matters um so it's really important that employers educate their employees on how staring can make people people feel an impact on people um to make sure that that's not a problem in your workplaces and we also have gesturing of a sexual nature in that middle bit too and then at the top of the pyramid we have behaviors that could could constitute a criminal offense so um flashing or cyber flashing um we have send in a colleague pornographic images um whether this be like online or via text um displaying pornographic or sexual images in the workplace groping stalking and rape and sexual assault so all of these behaviors are forms of sexual harassment at work and the reason that I have presented these examples in the pyramid today um is to illustrate how the presence of what people might consider the smaller less serious instances of sexual harassment in the workplace so the examples that we see at the bottom of the pyramid um can create an environment where sexual harassment is accepted tolerated and enabled to escalate and when we talk about escalation we don't mean that everybody who jokes um about sexual harassment or uses inuendos will inevitably go on to commit a criminal offense we mean that it creates an environment where people generally feel more comfortable aable um to go on to commit the more serious or what people would consider the more serious examples of sexual harassment um such as rape and sexual assault so it's important to remember that if we allow and enable the examples of sexual harassment that we see at the bottom of the pyramid to happen we normalize sexual harassment in all its forms and we really create that risk of escalation to the top of the pyramid in our workplaces environments where people make jokes about sexual harassment or similar also prevents and dets people from speaking up about all of their experiences of sexual harassment um because if someone hears someone joking about um say for example um someone's sex life it's going to make them feel that sexual harassment isn't taken seriously in this workplace um so we could actually see those instant types at the top of the pyramid go unreported in our workplaces as a result of a toxic culture created by the incident types that we see at the bottom of the pyramid so this is kind of how I like to explain to people why it's important that we call out all of these examples of forms of sexual harassment and when I was making this pyramid um I found it really difficult to rank kind of these um incident types and behaviors because all of these behaviors can have really significant traumatic impact on those who experience them and it can also all of them can have a really detrimental impact on wider workplace culture too um so none of these should be accepted and tolerated in your workplaces and the worker protection act really reinforces that and creates a mechanism for that to be enforced in law so we're now going to move on um to explore some real world examples of sexual harassment cases in the UK that ended up at employment tribunal in the last couple of years um as we run through these examples as I mentioned earlier I'm going to highlight some of the risk factors that were identified in these cases um at tribunal by the tribunal judge one of the reasonable steps that um employers are recommended to take um to be compliant with the worker protection act um and this has been Rec recommended by the equality and Human Rights Commission in their guidance is for employers to take um and conduct a thorough risk assessment of their work environment in relation to sexual harassment and this will involve um highlighting where there is a risk of sexual harassment in specific teams or contexts or business functions um and then taking steps on how you will act to mitigate the risks um and prevent sexual ual harassment in your workplace so the risk assessment piece is one of the key things um that you should be focused on when you're thinking about becoming compliant with this new law and we hope that these real world examples in today's webinar um will get you thinking where the risk is uh within your workplaces for sexual harassment and what you could be doing about it so case study number one um this case of sexual harassment happened in a Cas investment firm called whiskey 1901 um the employment tribunal heard that whiskey that at Whiskey 1901 within that workplace it was part of the normal working culture for male staff to refer to women as birds and for staff to boast about their sexual conquests at work and talk about their sex life openly in the office these examples were judged at the tribunal to constitute sh sexual harassment at work um so this is an example of what people might consider to be the smaller instances of sexual harassment actually being named as sexual harassment independently in law and the use of the term Birds to refer to women was said to by the judge to be a language indicator of a wider misogynistic culture in that workplace and then this case was was actually bigger than that too so in this case there was also a male manager who acted as a direct perpetrator of sexual harassment um and this involved asking a female team member invasive questions um which were which were judged to be sexual harassment so he asked her persistently um if she planned to get pregnant and this was judged by the court uh to be a clear instance of sexual harassment as the questioning was directly related to her agender so in this case in total um the female employee who experienced the direct sexual harassment um was awarded 51,0 776 in employee compensation this was obviously this this case happened before the new law um so it's important to note here that under the new worker protection act this could have received a 25% uplift in compensation as a result of the evidence of a misogynistic workplace cult gen evidence that there was no work being done to prevent sexual harassment in that workplace so the financial consequences could have been much bigger a real risk factor to be considered in this case is the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim um and the power imbalance between the two so the line manager relationship in workplaces just by its nature holds a high risk of sexual harassment um because line managers um hold a lot of influence in career and progression opportunities um so if a line manager is a perpetrator an employee might not want to speak up about their experiences of sexual harassment because they might fear as a result of this their career will be negatively impacted employees might also feel like because their line manager is more senior to them then the line manager's story will be believed automatically instead of their own um so this is another reason why people choose not to report sexual harassment that's perpetrated by their line managers and also in in some workplaces um the only place for employees to report incidences at work um of sexual harassment is actually to their line manager um or to HR who has a really good relationship with their line manager for example um so if there is a line manager who is a perpetrator um the person who's experienced in it might actually not know how to report the the experience of sexual harassment without this report being intercepted by the line manager and so that's also a huge deterrent um and again also oneto ones between line managers and employees frequently happen in really private environments behind closed doors which gives a lot of opportunity for sexual harassment to take place with nobody witnessing it um so people feel like how can I speak up about this there's no evidence he never or she never or they never do it in front of anybody else um so that is why that line manage relationship is so complicated um when it comes in terms when it comes to risk in terms of sexual harassment so therefore it's really important that when you're doing this work to become compliant with the work of protection act you must risk assess that line manager relationship within your organization um and really like dig into the complexity of those relationships to make sure that you're appropriately mitigating the risks moving on to case study two um this case of sexual harassment happened at a furniture company called star plan um so at the work Christmas party um a female employee experienced sexual harassment from a male manager and the employment tribunal found that the manager was um hugging her from behind without her consent um suggesting that they were going to have an affair um he touched her inappropriately and he made really sexualized comments about her body so the employee decided to speak up about her experience es of sexual harassment at the Christmas party um after the Christmas party and she experienced lots of victimization um from other colleagues and she said that um her employer had failed to protect her from this victimization um and that actually led her to resign and leave the workplace um and when we talk about this victimization this was colleagues IGN ignoring her at work so freezing her out um and also making comments threatening to kind of like take her down for speaking up about what she'd experienced and with that victimization it can it's evident that that behavior was really normalized and accepted within that workplace because people clearly felt like she was doing something wrong for speaking up about it so the claimant in this case was awarded 19,000 in employee compensation um and again given the facts of this case um under the new law the worker protection act this would have likely been increased by 25% for that um claimant and a key risk factor I wanted to identify in this case is the Christmas party um and the presence of alcohol at the Christmas party um as we approach Christmas party season um and everyone's very excited for those Christmas parties it's really important that in order to prevent sexual harassment you remind your employees ahead of the Christmas party that the party is an extension of the workplace and therefore normal expectations of acceptable behavior at work still stand um in that Christmas party context and I think that reminds her just before the Christmas party can go a long way um in in terms of the outcomes that you see um and also considering if you are planning the Christmas party considering um the level of alcohol that's involved in that Christmas party and the potential risks that are associated with that and again in this case we see risk associated with the power that managers hold um because the perpetrator was a manager um and that had like a huge impact on how this case played out um and we also see the impact of a wider negative workplace culture um so when the employee spoke up about their experiences of sexual harassment she experienced bull in and intimidation for speaking up so there was clearly not a speak up culture at that workplace or an understanding of what behaviors constitute sexual harassment sexual harassment was very accepted in that workplace um so it would have likely been judged in this case that um this workplace would not be compliant with the worker protection act because there's an environment which deters people from speaking up about their experiences of sexual harassment and finally um case study three so this case study of sexual harassment um is taken from a business support company called Gartner UK um a female employee experienced sexual harassment over the course of a year of employment as a sales executive for this company um important to note here that sexual harassment does not have to be a series of incidents it was in this case but it doesn't have to be um so something can happen just once and be judged in law to be sexual harassment um but the number of times instances happen can have an impact on the amount of financial compensation that an employee will receive at employment tribunal so if something is not um if inter if an intervention is not made um and something is allowed to persist and escalate and carry on then that can have an impact on employee compensation again in this case um the perpetrator was her manager and he made sexual advances towards her on a work trip and constantly referred to her as a good girl at work um he also joked um about pretending to be someone else on an online dating site in order to turn up um and he be on a date with him um and at first in in response to these kind kind of comments she she attempted to shut it down by joking back towards the comments and saying things like I'm not a good girl I'm a very independent woman um but when she began to speak up against these advances um from her manager in a more serious way so she moved from joking to being quite serious in in saying that what was unacceptable he used his senior position in the workplace to kind of take revenge um on him and that's how the the tribunal also put it they described that he took Revenge using his power um and he put her on a performance review unjustifiably caused her a lot of stress um the perpetrator would also send High volumes of texts on her work phone which because he was her manager she felt like she had to respond to um so that was him really using his position of power to manipulate her um and sexually harass her in the workplace and again it was highlighted by the employ employment tribunal judge in this case that the culture at Gartner UK was laddish and probably toxic so a couple of um key risk factors in this case there was actually um the employee compensation for this case was not actually published publicly um I don't know if that was just a choice or if it was as a result of an NDA um but I imagine that it was quite quite um a significant level of compensation um a couple of risk factors for this case um in this case the victim was the only woman within her team in the workplace um and it's important to note that there is a high risk of sexual harassment in environments which are dominated by one social group um so this could be an environment dominated by all women or all men um or it could be an environment for example dominated by heterosexual cisgender people H with only one or two colleagues who are part of the LGBT plus community so it's really important to risk assess uh your workplaces to identify maybe which teams or departments are dominated by one social group um and really risk assess these in your risk assessment for sexual harassment to making sure to make sure that your risk assessments really reach that level of detail that the worker protection act is looking for for compliance another risk factor here was work trips um being involved in the role um and the risks associated with traveling and staying overnight with colleagues um we also have the risk of colleagues being able to contact each other outside of work hours on mobile phones which are paid for by work um and this level of contact being normalized and unrestricted so there was no policy or principles implemented by the employer on what contact was normal outside of work hours and again we have the risks associated with a wider misogynistic culture um and how this plays out in these cases um so all of these risk factors are factors that you should be considering in your own workplaces when you do that risk assessment piece to become compliant with the worker protection act so finally before we move on to any questions um thank you for sticking with me today after that quite messy start by the way really appreciate it um so we have well I've actually developed um some training on this it's called preventing sexual harassment at work training um it's a half-day training session and it's delivered um entirely online so I'm going to tell you a bit about that today this session has been designed to give you lots of good practice in relation to preventing sexual harassment in the workplace and to really support you in developing your understanding of the reasonable steps that you can take to become compliant with this new law so building on some of the content today and going into lots more detail um it's a great session to attend to assess where you're currently at in your workplace in relation to this work and to begin to build and form your strategy for this work going forward um effectively preventing sexual harassment in the workplace requires a really wellth thought out robust long-term strategy and as I've mentioned a lot today I really thorough risk assessment and in this training we'll provide you with lots of really detailed guidance on how to develop your strategy and your risk assessment so to give you a bit more detail of what we'll cover in this training um we will cover the importance of understanding your workplace culture surrounded sexual harassment and also the importance of understanding prevalence of sexual harassment in your workplace um so you might have no idea um on the number of instances of sexual harassment that are happening in your workplace currently um so we'll talk through um what to do in this situation and how to really get that information um and the different ways that you can gain this information effectively so we'll cover how to understand exactly what sexual harassment is happening in your workplace um so that you can be really intentional in the action that you take to prevent it going forward we'll cover how to conduct a thorough risk assessment on your work work environment when it comes to sexual harassment and lots of good practice in relation to this so we've covered some of the risk factors to look out for today um but in the training we'll go into a wider range of risk factors and exactly how you can actually mitigate these um in your work environment we'll cover how to communicate with your employees about sexual harassment in the workplace so we spoken stay about the importance of raising awareness of all of the different types of behaviors that constitute sexual harassment at work um so we'll cover how to communicate with your employees about that um and also just more generally what makes an effective communication strategy when it comes to preventing sexual harassment in your workplace and culture shift actually did a little bit of research um well a lot of research and we'll share that with you after today's session in the followup in our white paper and but it found that one of the main things that employeers were concerned about in relation to the worker protection act was that Communications piece um so that's why we've we've included that in in a good level of detail in this training to respond to that need um we'll also cover building internal infrastructure to prevent sexual harassment so in this section we cover good practice when it comes to building or reviewing your anti-harassment policies and processes we will cover reporting and responding to reports of sexual harassment and how this is actually a tool of prevention how you can make it a tool of prevention in your workplace um so we'll look at what makes a good uh reporting and responding process um and how yeah how you can make a process which your employees will really trust and actually proactively utilized to speak up about their experiences of sexual harassment we'll also provide guidance on how to foster a speakup culture in your workplace in relation to sexual harassment um in the cases that we went through today there was not a speakup culture in any of those um and fostering a speakup culture can be one of the most powerful tools to preventing sexual harassment at work so if your employees feel imp empowered and trust you enough as an employer to speak up about their experiences of sexual harassment um that creates a huge deterrent for people committing those behaviors in your workplace and so it's crucial that that um speakup culture is fostered and included in your prevention work and finally we'll cover how to build a successful business case for this work within your organization um so in order to gain sponsorship for any projects that you might want to do um and to gain that senior leadership support and buy in um we'll cover how we build that really robust um business case um so in other words we will talk about how to get people to care about this work in your organization and we'd hope that this change in law um brings about that new level of accountability um and Sparks people's interests but that's not always the case so yeah we go through how to make a really compelling business case for this work so the training will be attended by a range of different workplaces and organizations at one time so it's a great opportunity to hear from other workplaces find out what they're doing in relation to this work um and also share challenges that you might be facing that they might be facing the training has been um informed by the equality and human rights guidance which have mentioned throughout today um and we're very fortunate that it was actually expertly reviewed viewed and endorsed by the foret society um so for those of you who are not familiar the foret society is the UK's leading membership charity for campaigning for gender equality and women's rights um and they really championed the introduction of the worker protection act um got it to be discussed in Parliament um and they're really passionate and experienced in improving the workplace for women um so they have reviewed this training um so yeah and endorsed it as as well and yeah um as a thank you for attending today's webinar um you will receive a discount code in our follow-up email um which you can use to get discount should you want to book onto this training um and additionally um my contact details will be in that follow-up so if you do have any questions about today's conte"
"t um or about the training and then please do reach out to me and I'd be very happy to hear from you and as um I mentioned at culture shift we've also developed a checklist to support you in getting started on this work um which will be included in that follow-up email too and we'll also include our white paper which is that bit of research that we did on the work of protection act um which is a great read and to get more detail on this area of work um so thank you very much for sticking with me and listening um and I'll now have a look at some of the question questions hopefully yeah we've got a few com in Charlotte shall I read them out to you yeah that'll be great yeah um so the first one um witnesses to sexual harassment can claim sexual harassment themselves that's posed as a question yeah um so I think as um if they if something has made them feel uncomfortable in the workplace they can take that um to employment tribunal I think it would be rare that we see um that actually reach employment tribunal as an alone a standalone incident um but that's definitely something that people should be able to feel empowered to report to their employer um and something that employer should be taken seriously so going back to that pyramid that I kind of explained we want to be stomping out those um bottom line behaviors to avoid escalation um so it's definitely something that someone could report to their HR teams or to their line managers um or on any other Reporting System that's they have in the workplace it also refers to the intent that you mentioned Charlotte it's it might be that someone was trying to harass a certain individual the intent was to the individual but it might have made other people feel uncomfortable within that environment so the the people or the Witnesses in the regards to this question could also report it as sexual harassment yeah and I think as well like a case that comes to mind is um when especially when people know that um certain comments makes an employee feel uncomfortable they will talk about that topic or about that topic around a certain employee um in the case that I'm thinking of it it was really kind of offensive to their P um religious beliefs um and so it can be quite weaponized in what people say around someone and they think just because they're not saying it to them it's not sexual harassment but it actually can be um so yeah how can you discipline someone and not just educate when it's something like staring or making jokes yeah so I think um education is definitely like a valid um intervention in this kind of work um so in that kind of case um it could be kind of if if the reporter was willing there could be a facilitated conversation between someone who's been a perpetrator of that behavior and someone who has felt a certain way about it and there could be facilitated conversations it could be line manager interventions so a line manager having a onetoone conversation with that person who has been reported um talking through their behavior talking through Behavior expectations and things like that um and then training can also be done as a targeted intervention um so it's not always turn into disciplinary it's really um useful to have all of those different ways to to re resolve reports of sexual harassment and I actually think by having those other options such as training line manager interventions mediated conversations and your employees knowing that these are options for report um for resolving reports to sexual harassment can actually boost reports and sexual harassment because often something might happen to someone it makes them feel really uncomfortable and they don't necessarily want their colleague to go through a formal grievance procedure and be dismissed so they don't speak up about it because they think that's the only option to resolve in sexual harassment but if they could speak up about it and there could be these other options such as training mediator conversations line manager conversations I think we'd see more of those low level behaviors reported and resolved um so it's a really good practice as an employer to advertise those as potential resolutions to reports of sexual harassment great just to add to that another question that's com in how can we mitigate the risks that you've observed between line manager and colleague what might those mitigations look like yeah so to answer that I'd be like definitely come along to the training um because we go into that in a lot of detail but I think um to to provide some mitigations um one of the really good ones that I came across was um empowering line managers and team members to be able to ask for oneto ones to happen in busier environments um so you have empowering people to have to be able to speak up and normalizing that in your workplace culture normalizing being able to say actually I'd like this one toone to happen in the cafe at work or in the open office and things like that so giving people the option to have those line manager conversations open offices um it mitigates that kind of assumption that you're definitely going to have time behind closed doors in private um also having really robust processes in relation to Promotions um so a promotion is not just in the the hands of one line manager it's a really formal process that people go through People review it um so there's there's less chance of abuse of power in relation to Promotions um yeah I think those and then obviously also line manager training and that real emphasis in your workplace on role modeling behaviors sorry role modeling behaviors and behavior expectations as well so there like a lot of a couple of different things that you could do to mitigate that power imbalance in the line manager relationship right who decides what is sexual could types of dress be considered sexual harassment if someone thinks the the dress or the outfit um might they might consider it to be sexual um does that mean like what someone is wearing could constitute sexual harassment I think that's what they mean yeah um I well again I think it's it's how it makes someone feel um obviously when these cases are brought to attention and when reports are made they're consulted on by multiple people judgment will be applied but I think in workplaces if someone if a way someone dresses offends someone and makes them feel uncomfortable employees should be empowered to report that um and then that will obviously go through a really robust analysis um and you know maybe potentially an investigation to kind of dig into the details of that case a little bit more um but I definitely think it's something that could be reported and should be encouraged to be reported if it makes someone feel uncomfortable yeah um what about neuro Divergent related staring would there be conflict under the equality act yeah I think that's that's um one of the biggest things that we see in relation to staring and I think that that's why staring can often be resolved um in those softer what you would say interventions so in um training in mediator conversations in line manager conversations um I think if someone has had an intervention the report's been made um we've had a line manager conversation and then um the behavior persists um then that would potentially just still be a case of sexual harassment that could be um taken to employment tribunal but often we see cases of um staring as um intervened at those lower levels um and behavior expectations explained have mediat conversations like things like that um that is that is the way we tend to see those dealt with I I've never actually heard of a case personally of neuro divergency being considered at that employment level um employment Tribunal level but I think that that's probably because these are mitigated and intervened at at lower levels um in my [Music] experience um would art related nudity also fall under potential sexual harassment um I guess that's an interesting I think um it would depend on the context and the case um definitely um so I'd be interested to hear more about like detail of what what they meant by that what the question meant but um again like it comes back to um that kind of interpretation if it's made someone feel uncomfortable people should be empowered to report it and there should be a discussion at least about um the case um because no one should feel uncomfortable in the workplace and but whether or not kind of so say if someone reported that um it could actually be judged this is actually appropriate because it is related to art but doesn't mean that the employer can't provide that employee employee who has reported it with suitable support with how they're feeling um or maybe suitable mitigation so they don't have to be around that art or um they don't have to interact with it so they they don't feel uncomfortable um so it's not all about kind of getting it to that top level of deciding whether it's sexual harassment an employment tribunal and but if someone if something makes someone feel uncomfortable there's other ways that we can mitigate that um and it should be reported I think if it makes someone feel UNC comfortable I think to add to that one that's where risk assessments come in place as well so risk assessments are done based on the industry in which you work um so somebody within the Arts who was doing a nude drawing for example would have to be taken differently to someone who was in a retail someone was stood nude in in the aisle of of a supermarket it's completely different and this risk assessment would be different in terms of the results and therefore the actions against that would also be different as well so I think some of these risk assessments are done on a case-by Case basis and that will be an example of one of those yeah right um I think we've got time maybe for one last question um and then we can follow up with um anyone who's got unanswered questions um after this um so this last question is relating to the point around outing someone as being LGBT Plus or sexualizing LGBT plus sexuality we understand this however would this be considered for someone that would not fall into that Community for example outing someone who is heterosexual um um yeah yeah I suppose so and I think usually in where people I guess people in workplaces kind of it's the assumption that everyone is heterosexual heterosexual um which isn't the case anymore there's very inclusive workplaces where people use like inclusive language and we don't assume that anymore but in some workplaces we would still assume that pretty much everyone is heterosexual um but yeah yeah absolutely um and we we can definitely see um similar examples so if there's a team which are full of people who are LGBT plus um and there's maybe one or two people who are hetrosexual we've seen examples um where that kind their sexuality has been um like kind of made jokes about and that can constitute sexual harassment um so yeah particularly in that context where there's the balance but it's flipped the other way um I think that that's where we see sexual harassment and yeah it can absolutely um definitely be examples of sexual harassment as well brilliant thank you I think that's all we have time for today oh yeah we'll um make a note of any other questions and and follow up as best we can um but yeah thank you so much for everyone um for coming along today um and yeah um get in touch with me if you have any questions about the training that we're offering""",,,,,,,,,,
